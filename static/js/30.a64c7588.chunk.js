Inordinate quantities of antibacterials and cleaning products come and go like the sun. Great tsunamis of special ingredients and arcane remedies pour into the Capital Zone from overseas.

A cargo vehicle is parked outside, two masked delivery men unloading at least a hundred identical crates. Each man is both energized and enervated, wildly mixed in affect, exhausted and slumped, racing at speed to finish the job.

Boring news by the standards of the age. There are worse things to worry about than terrorists of questionable veracity wielding poison pens.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLikewise the story fades once a "real" terrorist attack occurs, near mid-country, at a large federal building for intelligence warehousing. Early reports finger the IIIP Order.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother letter follows days later:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nDear mute and stupid lions.\r\n<br />\r\nDon\'t tell lies; don\'t risk your soul.\r\n<br />\r\nAll crimes began with the first lie, as we say in my household.\r\n<br />\r\nHave you forgotten that so soon?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n21 Aspect Ghost.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u220e\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThree days of rest, then another:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy don\'t you just leave it to the friendly mobs to handle?\r\n<br />\r\nYou seem to be running a cognitive deficit.\r\n<br />\r\nAlmost like something were interfering with the chemistry of your mind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo why not let us assist you towards perfection?\r\n<br />\r\nWe\'ll allow you just a few clues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe entered the store through the front door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe poison we used is dimethylmercury.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is no sacrament, medical or religious, which can save those marked with the 21 aspects.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe syringes we used are identical to billions of hypodermics in landfills everywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have poisoned many hygiene and antibacterial products in each 1000% FOOD within the Capital Megazone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have never poisoned goods at any other businesses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe will never do so.

Hospitals fill with the unneedy well and impossible pre-dead, blending with plague and rationing, blossoming between dueling news items on the resurgence of ARID and the 21 Aspect Ghost. Copycats arise just across the DMZ in the TorMin metropolitan area.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe order of vexation shifts and eddies, but the target, method, and toxin remain the same.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral members of the Antelectics, lauded as the <em>nouvelle vague</em> of Antediluvian artistry, are diagnosed with severe mercury poisoning. The prognoses are bleak. Soon they are followed by three members of the 1000% FOOD C-suite and several top members of the Misisim board.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo one at TAV bothers to ask which are the Operating Groups, which are TAV-adjacent terrorist cells, and which are simple copycats finding love in the propaganda of poison.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBrains melt, lungs fill with fluid, and the Archon seems distant as ever, a cold patriarch over a desperate country.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTAV moves ever-closer to diamond virtue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== yield ===\r\n+ [\u25fc]\r\n-\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== done(out_var) ===\r\n{\r\n    - out_var:\r\n        ~ XLR8R_OUT_PASSAGE = out_var\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n* [\u25fc]\r\n-\r\n\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="uh-oh-here-comes-corporate-security" />\r\n\r\n-> DONE'}}}]);
