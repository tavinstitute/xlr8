Our... guest, "Mother," has been called many things. The most insane woman in Antediluvian spirituality. A grifter and fraudulent medical experimenter. A dangerous cult leader driving her subjects to death through injurious and unscientific rituals. A truly energetic and inspiring faith leader. Some of what you\'re about to hear may not be suitable for children. Also, four nights after Mother taped her broadcast, she was declared an enemy of the Antediluvian state and excommunicated from the Antediluvian Church. Federal charges are pending and the "TAV Institute" has been declared a forbidden organization. What follows is Mother\'s last broadcast interview. Parental discretion is strongly advised.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_14_tape_intro ===\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n[<strong>START OF FILE</strong>]\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: This cult leader says she has more power over your children than you do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula [to camera]: They are heretics and cultists. The new craze, they tell me. Their heroes? Not the nice, clean war heroes of the Revolution... these are mad ideas of heroism, heretics and heterodoxy, schizophrenia made hip, trendy, and profitable. They\'re a group called the TAV Institute, and I am surrounded by many of them...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiates <bdi>\u05d0</bdi>, <bdi>\u05de</bdi>, <bdi>\u05ea</bdi> [reading the autocue]: In action!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Just let us see the TAV Institute in action. And say, devoted children of Mother...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n[film of Mother and TAV Institute lieutenants leading a sermon]\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I have such a, a fierce, intense... fire burning inside of me that just needs to explode.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[film ends and cuts back to the studio]\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: ...what does it all mean?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_14_meet_the_band ===\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Mother brags she\'s on her way to becoming the cult leader of record, the heresiarch of ages, for the Antediluvian youth. She already claims to have a million followers \u2014 and ladies, I don\'t mean your MyFans followers or the guys you\'re selling foot pics, I mean literal, wash-your-feet-at-the-intermission followers. Wherever she goes, she preaches to sellout crowds. And this is what they see. Sermons filled with violence, bloodshed, and revolution, a gospel accountable to none but herself and her idea of God. Every Antediluvian soul exhorted to ignore prosperity, to wear burlap rags, to freeze and burn themselves, walling themselves off in the dark, away from loving family and potentially fruitful partnerships. Men, women, and those apparently confused about the aforementioned categories, shaking in anarchic rapture, gibbering in tongues, nattering on about "uncreated light" and heresies of personal godhood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: That all sounds about right.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: I am told that your "NGO" [lightly slaps knee], during the end stages of the war, received nearly half a million credits from the Resurrection Authority. Doesn\'t that seem, er, to be slightly opposed to your whole, um, "anti-materialistic" view of life?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiate <bdi>\u05de</bdi>: No, the more the merrier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Really?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiate <bdi>\u05de</bdi>: Oh yeah.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Well, tell me more then.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiate <bdi>\u05ea</bdi>: We\'ve spent it, haven\'t we?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: I don\'t know, have you?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Yeah, it\'s all gone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Really?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiate <bdi>\u05ea</bdi>: Down the compassion hatch.

So, "Mother" wants to lead the young people of the Antediluvian State in a bloody revolution to take over the world, and she says nothing can be done to stop her. Why is that, <em>Mother</em>?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Nobody will stop me because I am the true underground prophetess. When you come into my zone, you\'re entering a spiritual war zone. I\'m out here for truth, religious liberty, the democratic soul... transcendence, all the way. I don\'t care about any state, boss, or anything else except the eternally transcendent soul. And your kids out there, if you got kids out there, I\'m going to be their new mommy. I am going to raise your children. They\'ll do anything I say, and I\'m going to tell them to hate everything about you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: And why is that? Why would any good-natured, sound-minded Antediluvian youth listen to anything you say?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Because I am only that which is and that which is true. They identify with me because the new and really free souls in this country are sick and tired of their parents, their schools, their people force-feeding them where to put their faith. They\'re sick of this country, they\'re sick of the world, they\'re sick of having bodies and thoughts. I am the answer. When they listen to my sermons, in person, on internet radio, on tubes and elsewhere, they\'re listening to the way that it really is. You know that, and I know that, so drop the pretense. Your children are my children. I am their Mother now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_14_interrogation_commences ===\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Now I want to know one thing...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInitiate <bdi>\u05ea</bdi>: Oh, what now?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Alright. I don\'t mean any disrespect here, I had never heard of you before we were going to do the show. And I did a lot of reading about you, alright? Now I wanna know is this, and I know I already sort of asked this, you seriously mean all this? You\'re for real?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Absolutely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: This is not an act?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I\'ve been doing this ever since I was a child. I have been... this is what you see. This is what you get. I do this, when I wake up tomorrow morning, I\'ll still speak the same way, I\'ll still look the same way, I\'ll still hear the same numinous voices in every gust of wind.

I am the <em>m\xe1rtur</em> in whom Stephen lives. I am the last prophet. I am the heresiarch of the religious underground. I am deliverance manifest, the telos, the beginning and end. I\'m dragging every one of you into a revolution against the government, the church, the City Antediluvian, against the lions, the Secret Swords, against any form of polite and unredeemed Antediluvian society that is trying to put us down or restrict us in any way, shape, or manner. You cannot give in! You must be a free soul. You can find your way back to Source without them or their lies.

Well, who told you you were the Archon\'s chosen messenger?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I do not speak for the Archon!

You, uh, go way beyond burning bushes and irresistible grace in your sermons, you self-mutilate on stage, you scream jeremiads against priests, parents, police, and states, you baptize people on a waterboard, I\'ve got an article here suggesting three people died at your compound after alternating between bathing in 10C and 85C water every half hour for 12 hours.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I self-mutilate, I scream the primal soul, I beat the <strong>[censored]</strong> out of my audience\'s brain if they\'re not willing to see the truth, I drive my flock towards the cliffs and the fields of fire, I take my\u2014 I don\'t care, I don\'t care about liars or bodies.

Do you, uh, are you, are you proud of what you do?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Absolutely proud of what I do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Why are you proud of what you do?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Because I am who I am and I\'m not an idolator like your audience here and the rest of the Antediluvian cattle.

And what I want is to give them what they need.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: This is, but this is, then why is that heresy? Why is that revolution or thought reform? They\'re consenting to give you their soul, ill-advised as that might be. Unless, of course, you\'ve <em>done something</em> to their brains, something that they can\'t say no to, or say anything at all...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: They\'re consenting, but I have had souls on stage that weren\'t consenting, and I don\'t care.

What do you really think is so special about you?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I\'m a very... unbelievable person, because I believe in myself and I have a very strong mind and I can produce truth about anything I want. And most people go through life very bland, and very boring, and they accept what\'s given to them, they accept what people teach them and what people tell them. I have said no, over and over again, to authority. Authority cannot tell me what to do. The churches cannot tell me what to do because from day one I never listened to them. No matter what I said I was always still myself.

I can\'t do all this over again. I\'m done with recurrence.

Why do I want to get old and be reincarnated?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: Is this what happens? You get old, then you get boring or you get reincarnated? I didn\'t even know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: Well, most people do.

Most never peak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlba-Insula: \u2014hold on. Okay. You immediately, uh, you assume that all of us out here are boring people who won\'t go to Heaven. Is that your assumption?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother: I assume that, just by looking at most of you, you probably are.

I\'m going to live forever because my soul\'s too strong. You\'re the one who\'s gonna go to nowhereland, baby. Cause I\'m gonna live forever, my soul is too strong to [unintelligible] kill.
