Psychonauts and tricked-out firearms, dying for the men they dream of, but like, super heroically, leaving behind sexy corpses. Daddy doms, natch, absolutely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow I think I\'m getting ideas. Feels like I\'ve got some weird sort of... womanly change, building in me, some new music in my body.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUgly chick turning peregrine, singing all her deadly stories. Stuck in visions most masculine, just the facts when you\'re the cool girl.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDear 00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nheyyyyy there bb, wyd, here\'s a picture of my bhole, you up, you down, are you looking, do you want to help me get bred? I\'m chilling with some famous stars, way up here in near Earth orbit. Sharing their heavenly bodies, you\'re in everyone\'s silhouette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m staring down upon your manse, maybe I can crash your wedding, have a hard fuck on your duvet, stains on your finest linen set. Body shots with tipsy bi girls, drinking freezing \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044b, lying to your monied in-laws, nibbling on toasted bruschette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll get plastered on your vodka, hiding within your well-trained crowd, sazerac, sidecar, and Joven tequila, very dry gimlet. When you finally locate me, I\'ll be munching your angel food cake, pulling mussels from a soft shell, down sucking oyster mignonette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGive to me a darling nickname, please tell me my sobriquet. You can call me your dear Annette, I\'m Adriette and Acquanette, Babette, Brigette, or Charolette, Dynette, Fleurette, Lisette, Odette, it\'ll never matter to me, I\'m a tease, your cum dumpsterette. If you think that I\'ve been naughty, you can toss me in your Bastille, use my head to please society, I\'m your sweet darling Antoinette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s the game that you\'ve been losing, I\'m Komarov, you play Brezhnev; throw me your tiny capsule, I\'m in panties bought by my ex. (You wouldn\'t know him, not your type, he\'s some kind of a baronet. Billions of creds, many houses; perks of banging a Marquisette.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStrapped to your adult horsey-set, breaking records of endurance, I\'ll ride atop your chariot. in <em>cache-sexe</em> and my camisette. Innards boiling hot as engines, showing off my structure\'s cleavage, screaming, pleasure, pain, heard as both, double-D crimson balconette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll my soft fingers held by G, burning for your morality, smoke is rising from my brassiere, your incandescent sufragette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCommand is on the radio, should\'ve sent men and not a bitch, crying, sobbing, and lamenting, now their duty\'s ever unmet. Yelling in their \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 phonemes, hissing the standard \u0430\u043b\u0444\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442. I\'m all but dead already, baby, doomed to Hero Soviet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll my hours up in heaven, I was stiff, polite, and erect; now I\'m frightened, mouse without wolf, endangered, marooned avocet. When I\'m warned by friends who worry, I\'ll name you as my own grenade, blast to be embraced in honor, my heroic shredding casket.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m a hooker, bearing baggage, most resilient to good intent, sinfully I pray to my God, I\'m still in hock for Father\'s debt. I\'ll take every D, C, and V, then I\'ll fix my female problems; first dilation, then sedation, last in line will come the curette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo whenever you say the word, I\'ll go down on your ambitions, flaming red hair, soft mouth melting, the Day of Workers, hard descent. Pushing-pulling dead-broke buttons, failing, aborting, lost diskette. I\'m riding down to Earth in flames, singing every dismal regret.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrying and hollering at you, promising ghostly sharp revenge, I\'ll be your snowy owl tonight, cursing your callsign in dulcet. Have one of my exes call me, you can listen to him talking, he\'ll reveal to you betrayal, affairs, my most slutty vignettes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the nights I should\'ve stayed there, with him nestled in my backside; I fled through the bathroom window, found another guy instead. Quite easy, a woman\'s excuse: we all know however it ends, there\'s still something there to be flushed, some pissed-out or spat epithet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust a girl orally obsessed, like smokers chewing nicotine, or ancient Shakespeare\'s Juliet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we\'re done, I will have melted, just a quivering hot woman, pooling on my bed like batter, bubbly pancake, boiling pallette. Look at me, a messy woman, in need of so much elbow grease, smeared across your pricey paintings, resisting all but carbon tet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy dark-flamed rockets smolder bright, hose me down with your big soaker, I don\'t mind where it all ends up, I love every way girls get <em>etc</em>. If it gets all over my hair, and it won\'t come out showering, I\'ll just dye it for you again, pale-blonde curtains, drapes in brunette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI, yr manic pixie musette, am in need of lots of pumping, cover me in sweet melanges, of all our fierce, devoted sweat. No matter what, my fire will rage again, so you can shoot your Willy Pete, sending your flares arcing on high, then the Archon will take the rest.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccustomed to girl corpses, he\'s omnipotent in character, been around the block many times, he\'ll easily judge a grisette. If you need time for decision, you can bury me in deep woods, cool me down for a good period, unearth my body for reset.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn time I\'ll escape to your house, dragging my cut knees to your love, you\'re my dearest ragged dolly, my grave mouth\'s upon your asset. If you decide against my heart, you can go into your phone book, I\'m there as "<em>ETAOIN SHODAN</em>," replace my nickname with a <del>STET</del>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI won\'t be sad when I meet doom, I\'ll get a beautiful sendoff, balalaika, cello sextet, mandolin, alto clarinet. Rifle shots and mournful cornet, presidential words from leaders, then at last, but hardly softest, a cannonade, distant corvette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI like jetpacking and rough trade, that\'s how we\'ll find ourselves meeting, on the first night of <em>T\u1ebft M\u1eadu Th\xe2n</em>, I\'ll burn down your whole <em>t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate</em>. You\'re welcome to play the Marvin, I\'m the PAVN PAWG hot-dropping, flying phoenix with her rifle, invading your most private f\xeate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m a cuddler battle-hardened, tough to crack, hard as a barbette. I\'ll follow you to the Tate Modern, artful girls in bougie aigrette. Shrimp cocktails and Bloody Marys, spotters up on the parapet. I\'ve got an automatic handy, right here behind the colonette. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLook, 00ddf7, up in clouds, in deepest blue sky, I\'m a phoenix resurrected, a <em>weltgeist</em> and your major threat. A painted woman in olive drab, flying over Greenwich vistas; watch me falling with my HALO, I\'m soaring like an Exocet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGot a Ka-Bar in my holster, satchel charge, and some torpex. On top of that, I\'m still holding five hot grams of super-pure ket. You know we go to all the parties, and we\'re always coming correct. Pass me the freebase calumet, did you get word from Tina yet?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEncamped with seven, jungle ghosts, we\'re out on a girls\' vacation, monsoon season, two full lances, a feminine squadron octet. We\'ll read the other\'s fortune lines, stripping down to our underthings; playing the longest game of War, doing all her foxhole toilette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m just a lowly maidservant, I just worry I\'ll leave your heart, with all those years you\'ll spend living with the rich girl on the inlet. A fair concern, you will agree: I\'ll be smashed and then cremated, all my parts are flying quickly, first Tolyatti, then to Tibet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen this has all been said and done, they\'ll put up statues of my face, leaving you to gaze upon my last singular and deathless part. A skinny, glassy, fragile heel, fitting only servant women: those who serve in pride by daylight, at the zero, secret coquette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs for me, I\'ll be curled up in a scale model of a dead girl, sleeping cozy with the dancers of the perfect silent ballet. Trapped inside my void of loving, I\'m so stuck upon your beauty, can barely even touch my lunch, I\'m so besotted and beset.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou\'ll be sitting in a limo, when I aim my third eye at yours, holding hands with your darling love, that\'s when I\'ll fire my big rocket. Then you\'ll see all that I saw there. Camouflaged in clothes of order, drummer of the Matron\'s army, I\'m soloing your last duet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou know, of course: the month we met, nightly cries I\'ll always beget. Your devoted, hash-mad killer, in ways we\'ll never soon forget. You may not have seen me out there, with how I blend into a crowd, but I saw you speaking last week, at the wall of north and sunset.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou raved maniacally for days, speaking of oneness and pastry, asking passage for the peacocks, for the spider, and every pet. The king will weep forever now, a heavy blow against the world, that\'s my intent, yes sir, of course, and my true name, hence the dragnet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou know how the story goes now: I hook up with my marksman boy. Our special meet cute started when I bummed a cigarette. That night, like the bad girl I am, I suck his cock in the couchette. Pay for hotels, stay up till dawn, getting pounded in the dinette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll do redux in the morning, he\'ll take me in the kitchenette. Waking the next night to aching, sponging blood with cleansing towlette. Getting boyfriends with my smart mouth, just what girls do for attention, I\'ve learned in time to love a punch, yr Judy, bimbo marionette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy understudy bunny-boy is standing on the grassy knoll, he\'s merely there so he can aid, and as needed, duly abet. He\'s a sweet boy, very upset, so instead I\'ll take your bullet. I\'ve got a perfect shot up here; depository minaret.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe day you die, he\'ll be fresh from his gap year in CTSZ, former cadet, with a big heart, bigger trauma, a rev-time vet. Face is like a cartoon rabbit, with a cute scar upon his neck; we change the whole game with our shots, kill is confirmed, nothing but net.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen it all hits you will be out there, networking, schmoozing, red carpet. Cameras flashing in the dark, photographers, every gazette. When I detonate your mindset, you\'ll be speaking your acceptance, plotting all the afterparties, fresh new interns, gold statuette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you feel you\'d like to see me, before our most fateful meetup, my grave is in the Bleeding Square, I\'ll be lying in the deep state. You\'ve been reading so much on it, out there in your sad, sad exile, neutron-salted techie burnout, rotting rags, and nightly cold sweat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll let it all make sense again; all I demand\'s a few sharp words, butcher me with your sharp longsword, then toss me in your oubliette. We\'re really the same, you and I, you just like your meals to be small; clearly I dream about assault, just listen to me screaming "\u043d\u0435\u0442."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSlam me down onto fields of grain, stab me with your lustful rapier, shatter all of my female bones, harder, Daddy, tear my fourchette. Fuck me to the death my dearest, so hard that I see distant lights, I\'ll be screaming "God, I\'m coming," brain a burning-hot pulsar jet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShort and ripped skirt, thoughts are fading, blank eyes and the milk of briquette, smeared cheap makeup, fluids given, a cardiac high chansonette. Saline, BP, X-ray, blood ox, and coding footfall castanet, CT reading, gauzy purdah, rescucitative minuet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBlue lips, green fields, holy trumpets, gold light, dark star, sudden onset, white bitch, black lace, sitting shiva, and all the bone-dry anisette.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("CAGED")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTa ta, till <em>th\u1ea3m s\xe1t t\u1ea1i Hu\u1ebf T\u1ebft</em>,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_cool_one ===\r\n{switch_sounds("BAD DEED")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt\'s almost two AM, I\'m terribly lonely, you\'re not replying to any of my DMs, and I\'m thinking about getting back on that app again. You know, the one I told you about, where I get to feel like a real woman, just because a hundred men want to show off their cocks, and pay me to taste them. It\'s clearly not even about the money. They just get off on the idea of me being something available for purchase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhoring\'s a terrible sin in the eyes of the Archon, I know. He prefers we have a fairly clear idea of how many men have rung our bells, held open our doors for us, tracked dirt on the floor. Misdeeds sooner forgiven in spreadsheet form. Maybe he just gets off on reading it; like you. I\'ve got so long a list I can\'t even start to count. That\'s why I deserve nothing more than you, and why I\'m finally ready to step down off a whirling carousel operated by so many proud, dutiful men back home. Back down to terra firma.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou know I won\'t be able to give up the sin of it, though, the naughtiness of seeing myself, degraded before the ever-watchful LORD. <em>Nackt</em>, as they say, each and every <em>nacht</em>. We can just turn it into another of your games, pretend like it\'s not even real, that our bedroom\'s a city beyond time, you\'re governor-for-life, and we put it all away when we put our clothes on and wash off the sweat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPut your key to the city in my economic engine, baby. Fire my hearth and bring my <em>Ruhr</em> back from blasted idleness. Call me all the names you already know I love. Slut, whore, pig, dumpster. Call me your filthy <em>erdschwein</em> of a girl, your ever-curious <em>schweinswal</em>, <em>meerschweinchen</em> for your sexiest plots, your lonely <em>stachelschwein</em>, always consumed with the dilemma of fierce hearts. Schwein haben, mazel tov, see you again next Monday at OOB. Or should that be OOV?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou and I can get onanistic in the original, I\'ll see how I look with a few different styles of pale jewels, and you can take a siesta while I play the bejeweled businesswoman, hard at work, a pretty girl covered in dirty secrets.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s the coordinates to my hidden treasures, my private cache, my ceremonial scimitar, my lost officer\'s <em>beutepanzer</em>:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("BAD DEED")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA thousand truffles in exchange for your heart,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_cool_two ===\r\n{switch_sounds("GAGGED")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt really is true what they say. In your absence my heart has grown fonder than I knew possible, my passions white-hot. The black-body radiator that keeps these engines running is neither anymore. I\'m burning for you and I\'m nothing but love anymore. My fantasies have grown black as paper, aflame. I\'ve tried to drown my sorrows, my secrets, but they all float. I paid tender attention to my weeping gash, my crying scar.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI saw, I remembered my chains, I came. I\'ve been sleeping with the card you gave me under my pillow. The one with your private numbers. You remember that day, and the outfit I was wearing? How the world seemed to bounce along with my sundress?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSet the date and make your final preparations, lover. Put on your finest cologne and work up an appetite or two through self-denial. Feel that river building behind of the dam of your barely-constrained passions. I\'ll light a taper in the pitch-dark night, as bright and vulnerable as if I were smoking in the jungle, a cowboy killer drooping from my pillowy lips, and you were the sniper.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen I can induct you into the lowest mysteries a girl can practice, and you can paint stains on my soul in the shape of a pearl necklace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust remember: it\'s not the heat, it\'s the dust. I\'m in the air and the soil, darling. You\'re always breathing my pheremones, the delicious stink of my collective affections, the miasma of my violent lovers\' soul. I can see your mouth hanging open, your fangs bared. I know you\'re getting the message I\'m putting out one way or another.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou butter me up right, maybe I\'ll even tell you about the skin flick I saw as a little girl, the one that showed me, in full definition and delicious clarity, the kind of woman I knew I\'d grow into.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt\'s about a girl in need of medical attention for something clearly soul-deep and invisible on the flesh save for terror, the kindly doctors who help her heal for twenty-five minutes or so, and the green felted operating table atop which they effect her repair. No scratches, no cue track, just the rhythm of moans, and the low, steady beat of a young woman leaning waaaaay back into the magic 8-ball.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe can trace S-curves across my past as I show you how I learned to be a cool girl, rough-talking, long porcelain legs, tight and loose in all the right places, a queen of diamonds in the boardroom, a freaky princess of hearts in the sheets, wired for sound, honey-voiced and girl-toned come hithers, down to the death, down for whatever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMost foreplay is just women talking about the disgusting things they did, and will. We both know that.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMaybe we\'ll get so wrapped up in storytelling we\'ll forget who we are. I think you\'ll find another way we\'re the same, my dear, is that we clearly love to mix business with pleasure. So let\'s play secretary and boss till the end of the world, in an ice cube prison rendered too extraordinarily to appear on any maps, too distant to be glimpsed by eyes but ours.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll be your frost witch. You play the fire mage. I\'ll be nothing but a girl-shaped puddle when you finish, and you can smoke yourself to sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMurmur this to yourself, as you torch your way down the trellised paths of my domain:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("GAGGED")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMllions of caresses, billiards of love,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_cool_three ===\r\n{switch_sounds("FACADE")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI want to show you I\'ve grown up. I got a job, learned a trade, found a newer, better me, and I\'m ready to dedicate myself anew to us. Let me be yr secretary and amanuensis, baby. You tell me all the rot in your soul, and I\'ll turn it into poetry. I won\'t even ask for vacations or sick days. I\'ll never blame you for lashing out at a job, 99.9999% done already, for not being perfect.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy would I? Perfection\'s the name of the job for a professional girl. It\'s what we sell, and no one wants to buy from someone who\'s not down on their knees, Monday to Monday, 0500 to 2100, in a pretty dress and full makeup, eating from a dog bowl.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo let\'s hear your prospectus. I\'ll help you get all the way to the big I-P-O. Let\'s see all your box plots, all your Gantt charts. Let\'s hear about when and who you burn, and how fast. Let\'s talk agile. We can sprint across the wastelands together, you and I, and forget every month on the calendar. We can fuck like it\'s February 29th, every day of the calendar. You can pay me under the table, and I\'ll do the job so quiet you can hold meetings while I\'m at it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI can be your rockstar, your too-smart horse girl with an impossibly dense horn. I\'ll play you something angular and constant, crunching a hundred chords and accidents into a single explosive delivery. You can keep me in black or red, I look just as good in either, and put pips on my uniform, scarlet clusters and leaves, for every time I forget I\'m launching into something unknown.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere\'s no way to do this, looking like me, with this dismal star chart of mine, and work as anything but a whore. I know that. I\'m fine with it. Just give me a bonus every once and a while, cash or something liquid. Pat me on the head. Tell me I\'m doing a good job. Then you can go right back to exploiting me like I\'m begging for, working me skinny, finding labors yet in these sunken skeleton eyes of mine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere\'s hardly anything to lose \u2014 you know full well I was made to decline in the most feminine terms, and the juiciest bits stay plump to the last. Almost enough to not even notice my eyes as void, my voice as soft falsetto nothingness, my thoughts as prompt radiation, spilling out in every flavor and direction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou\'re welcome to label this a failure; I expect it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll take each of our 1:1s, filled with my half-remembered readouts of half-memories you\'ll always phrase as lies, with you red-faced, mad-eyed, dancing down the line of propriety with the pride of a champion. I\'ll give you all the salted fear I know you need from the girl in my position.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll make it so when you\'re in bed later, it\'ll be easy to get yourself off the hook, talking to yr pillow. Like none of it was even your fault or doing, like you\'re just a nice guy who happened to be there, not even rich or smart enough to be evil. You own all the risk, of course. No dissent here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can even send me off to the wolves whenever you want. I\'ll be standing in the shape of a ramrod, the heaviest pushup upon my chest, and you can show me what it feels like to be deflowered on direct orders.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe\'ll be so confused she\'ll keep sputtering the same lie about needing to inspect my leg for contraband, and I, the illicit girl, will learn the lesson all dutifully professional women do. There\'s no theoretical limit to how much of me can be valuated over an office table, nor how forceful the bargain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo slice me into infinitesimal pieces with your Gaussian copula, pumpkin. I promise I won\'t even pout, just as long as you give me enough off-screen time. Just a short call on a girl bound to be volatile any day now, no misses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf I ever complain, and show you a moving average of my vomma-driven concavity, ask you to call me Vanna, Volga, Vera, Charm-a-lot, apple marmelade and bread crumbs in a feminine tin, Union Jack on the label, carbide-blue and dimpled, you can just repeat those same magic words:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>"How was I supposed to know?"</li>\r\n    <li>"What does this have to do with the deliverable?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Why are you telling me this?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Isn\'t that just what I pay you for?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Why are you telling me this now?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Why are you angry?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Why is that my fault?"</li>\r\n    <li>"When you got to the port, were you dressed as I asked?"</li>\r\n    <li>"What could I have even done differently?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Why does it matter now?"</li>\r\n    <li>"What can I do about it now?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Didn\'t you notice the scars on my wrist?"</li>\r\n    <li>"Don\'t you care about being a team player?"</li>\r\n    <li>"I know you don\'t want to hear this, but I\'m sorry."</li>\r\n    <li>"Remember we\'re a family. I just want you to know we love and care about you, 973b4f."</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNever a truer thrill in a broken girl\'s body, and you know there\'s no tongue by which I\'d rather be lashed. I\'ll wear my hair up, braided nice and high, so you don\'t have to worry about doing it for me. After all, isn\'t this just how families are? Love isn\'t uncruel. That\'s what girls think.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s the update for all the tickets I filed for you. I made sure to produce lots of metareferences for them, like I know you love to demand and never read:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("FACADE")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYr hyperreferential Metatron,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nin the highest fidelity available, with bleeding-edge tools,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_psycho_ingress ===\r\n{switch_sounds("FEED")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOh, 00ddf7.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat else to call this but love?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow else to label the feeling I\'ve vivisected, pinned to the corkboard of my sins? I want to open my wet, sloppy mouth, my hungry lips, wide as they\'ll go. I promise I can gobble you up whole, and every bit you leave for me. I\'ll get to see if you taste like what I always imagined, and you\'ll get to learn what it is to live inside the belly of a jackal. There\'s a chemical peel waiting for you in there.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou\'ll look like a whole new man. What might be left? What\'s been hiding under the surface, behind your soft skin and tousled hair? Who even knows what you might glimpse, down there in the dry sexpot of my fragile Machiavellian heart? What kind of fierce and terrible visions might wriggle loose from your soft and curving belly? What flashbacks of your trainwreck past might jump the tracks, caroming towards your groomed riviera at terminal velocity?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA girl as rabid as me, you know I\'m already afraid of water, so it\'s gonna be like a desert down there. You like them young and hot, and we know how Albionians feel about dry, but we\'ll need more than a couple of social lubricants. Then you can treat me like a game console, and I can show you my cheat codes. I hope you came prepared for strip poker. I\'m not tough \u2014 it\'s a game I play to lose. Just like the one we\'re playing right now, in a strange sense.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nListen, 00ddf7. Out there on the river, a hundred lives over and done in perfidy and turpitude, tamed long since, soon wild once more. Even the mudlarks hear the trumpets. Why do you think they left? It\'s surely not why you did, because you can only hear yourself. Time to change the song.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe truth is that you\'re a great liar. But that\'s not going to help you now. You read all the books, you decrypted all the codes, you built your own ciphers and cults. But you never learned any of these lessons. I bet you don\'t even know where any of this came from. You\'ll never even know my given name. That\'s part of what makes all this so hot, what keeps me thinking about you every day at work, my fingers creeping down to my hips like Hypercorine, playing it casual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust make sure, when you\'re in there, that you don\'t look at the framed family picture of me, out there in the most high and mysterious zone, standing next to my own archons and adversaries, and the icon of my original sin. You know someone this beautiful, this strong, this insane...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n...you know it\'s gonna be horrific. And who knows? Maybe you\'ll find out that the violence of struggle is what got you hot this whole time, and the temperature was always incidental. What\'s more erotic in a man than the willingness to push himself to new frontiers of masculine debasement, wielded? What\'s sluttier than a girl who\'ll give it all up to show you that what she really craved this whole time was getting bred by death?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s your numbers, babe. Here\'s your sign. Let\'s bugchase the end together. You be Foucault, I\'ll be Marienbad, gorgeous and spread wide against a burning impossible sunset. You will be shown visions of the edges of the universe. We\'ll be a chimera of hatred, you hating me, me hating me, gaze by gaze, lash by lash, stroke by stroke, beat by beat, four on the floor, just like they always taught was the Archon\'s will.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe can play army. I\'ll lay back, thinking of Albion, meditating on my doom, learning to love it, and you can blow me away. How many whippings do you think I\'ll deserve for all my selfish crimes against your heart? Just try to aim below the belt, I guess. We both know visible scars make a woman look older.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe ones she can keep hidden to everyone but her favorite men, the ones she chose to have written on her for no other reason but that she loves to see herself used? Those just make her even more alluring. And I don\'t have a more favorite man to dote on than you, 00ddf7. Never have, never will. You\'re one of a kind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you want to really turn me on, whisper this in my ear. It\'s what I want you to do to me in the dark, after you get my blood flowing proper quick.

What\'s that one word? The ancient Byzantine one. An interregnum in chronology, the insertion of a molecule of time into a larger frame, a sort of flourish that keeps the structure pure but doesn\'t quite move us forward, a migration of something from one zone to another. An evacuation in more ways than one. Or maybe I\'m losing it again, thinking of an old rifle instead of a real idea.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember, if you could ever forget, this is Albion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHalf is fourteen, a perfect fourth is merely five, a fifth\'s either seven or a whole 757 of fun crashing into your mind, an eighth\'s a cue ball that attacks gloaming fatigue, sustaining to the shattering release of dawn, an ounce is three and a half, a pound\'s anywhere between sixteen and your whole life, A4 is always the same as A440, A102\'s always too loud, M4\'s always jammed halfway to the end, a dime piece is just a few hits of loud icky sticky, the bakers offer their wares only in fateful quantities, and we, like Zemelo, Russell, and all others who strove before us, shall never complete this set.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA mutt for a jailer, the polite void her law, and none of it ever should\'ve made sense.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHear the thunder of my perfect mind, if you\'ve blood left after the flash. I\'m already screaming back towards full power, and a violent frequency beyond perception.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt must have been so bereaving, losing the game, winning such a dismal lottery. She might know plenty of Albion\'s finest, she\'d even admit to crying on a few of their shoulders, but does she know Albion\'s killing heart? And is a chair at the banquet really enough to keep you happy? I doubt it, babe. I really, really do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI heard you howl, 00ddf7. I copied that waveform and I scraped at it like a palimpsest, brushing all your skeletons and baubles clean. A calendar year of ceaseless exvacation, and I never stopped until, at the darkest nadir of your shadowed zone, I found my name.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s the torch I lit at the bottom of the darkest well for you. What\'s more romantic than a dinner with a master of his trade, all the lights dim and flickering, supernovae dancing in my inkwell eyes? I\'m such a lucky girl. And what is a candle but a rocket, reversed?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("ADAGE")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYr sexagesimal girl,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_psycho_two ===\r\n{switch_sounds("CAGED")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDarling, delicious confessor of mine, I know you feel heavy too. All the defeats, the deluge of hatred, the wheat of success transformed to chaff of desertion, and not even enough to shake my camera eye. It knows your shape too well to be fooled by any number of glittering things. How hard is it, after all this, all the blood and molding rags, not being devoured by a hunger for revenge? Devoting your life to anything other than reckoning, accounting, retribution, et cetera?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll make it all better, though. Who knows more about it than me? Je suis votre prisonni\xe8re d\'amour, mon li\xe8ge \xe9lite, qui \xeates plus pr\xe9f\xe9r\xe9e dans le cordon sanitaire de mes lombes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember, I\'m easy. Throw me onto the floor and I\'ll burst. Bleed me and I\'ll run dry. All I need is a few pomegranate seeds, you can sip a pineapple cocktail, heavy on the clear liquor, sweet burning, needles of pine, and you already know I\'ll give it all up at the end of the first date. I always do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCome bring me cordial things. You can pull my hair, climb me like a tree, root around in my boudoir while I freshen up. You can go through my drawers of frilly clothes, even get a close-up, play a dress-up game in your head, sample the goods. Only if you want, though. I\'m a very permissive woman but I\'d never tell you what to do; that\'s just too simple and direct for my tastes. It\'s for girls who like answers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m just in it for the questions, and the frisson before they\'re resolved. None of this is ever gonna be as real for me as it is for you, that\'s why I get so into it. Gotta compensate for all that blank space. Surely you\'ve noticed by now I\'m too much of a horror vacui girl for line-stepping.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo, I scratched the line out with my stiletto, redrew it behind you, and now I\'m floating over your head claiming it was always right there, and you broke the code.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe can go out to a huge party. I\'ll hang off your arm, dressed to the nines in a dress that evokes blood, with enough decolletage to grab every eye in the room. I\'m one of those girls lucky enough that all her gluttony ends with her tits or ass, more often on her back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey, your envious onlookers in the hundreds, won\'t know whether to look at me and think about eating, or look at you and think about wearing your skin in the dark, play-acting at that adorable schoolboy accent. You can even fuck me in the toilet if you want, like bad girls do when they think no one will find out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember when I crept into your house and drew a Celtic cross from the deck in your drawer? You thought it was someone else; a robber or madman. You got so freaked you replaced your locks, if I recall, and it took you a week to figure out how the new tech worked. I left a note that I knew wouldn\'t make sense until today, and you assumed it never would. Now it does.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s your truth, 00ddf7. Here\'s your fact. This time I just made sure you\'d know the etymologies. Here\'s your source: it was <em>always</em> me, babe. And it always will be. Nothing\'s ever gonna take my eye off you. Not wind, not rain, not plague, not cash, not friends, clearly not even death. Just one dead cool girl, and the dreamy kitten of a boy she simply can\'t get over.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s the timestamp of the day I died. You can feed it to the oracles, they\'ll return the image of me in my funeral dress. Maybe someone even got an upskirt? I\'d be disappointed if they didn\'t. Of course I won\'t mind what you do with it. I promise, baby.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("CAGED")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSmooches eternal,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_psycho_three ===\r\n{switch_sounds("FACADE")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis was always coming. Every love affair only works because both of us know passion is quickly torn in half, like nightclothes ripped and thrown aside. Clearly it never about you. Just a cruel father I never had. Just a temporary vacation on the borderlands of feminine hysteria. Just a[nother] year of womanly experimentation. But that\'s still responsibility, I\'ll grant you that. That much I owe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou may be a John, every man is, and every woman\'s a hardy assassin, but every John deserves his letter along with his magic bullets. I\'ll do you one better by telling your fortune before I go. Here\'s your last major draw, an aleatory with only one Nash equilibrium. Here\'s one last success to bring with you into exile, before your last big revelation. Mind the colorful fungi and the living creatures.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCan you hear it yet, 00ddf7? It\'s been playing in your ears this whole time. You just couldn\'t see the staff, nor the hand pointing at the breakers, charged with divinity, ready to split you down the middle. Now you get to play catcher, and I\'m a quiet girl with a big, thick bat. This line drive\'s going straight towards you, and no matter which way you point, you\'re gonna take it from behind.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut first: get down on your knees, O sweet, soft, smooth, pretty sinner, and atone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou know what comes next. You\'re a creature of adversity, a child of empire born under a killing moon, a binary star whose twin has gone dark. Me too, darling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat\'s why we were always meant, you and I, to end up way, way down in the Thisb\u0113an crypt together, under the pyramid of the oldest gods. I get to drink all of the hot consolamentum, the exact warmth and flavor of a man, the little death gone gokkun, a <em>very</em> bad girl going terribly wild for the last time, \u03ba\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd swimming through her stomach, medium as message as dial tone, repeating ad infinitum. I always did love a good alkaloid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou, my darling Romeo, get to fuck yourself with a sword.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n(What? Don\'t look at me like that. I\'m a size queen and I got bored of daggers before I left uni.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRepent for all of it, give up every kilogram of your flesh, die a sinner, grab the electrical lines, throw yourself atop the rails in advance of the trolley, I don\'t care. Just give all of yourself to me, or at least my memory, with all the devotion you applied to every endeavor past.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was already written, too high up in the stars for either of us to read, long before we were born, before the universe even was. Just two pieces of jailbait in a cosmic prison, sopping with heme. Even now they can\'t make it taste like the real deal with synthfoods. That\'s why you and I never lost our taste for blood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo pick me. I\'m not ashamed, I\'ll admit I\'m a pick-me type of bitch. But you know it\'s right. Here\'s your final task. Then you can leave the milieu.

So many picture messages, so little time. Oops. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe nice ones don\'t get mad when I don\'t respond, at least.

You know I\'ve been a very bad girl.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'ll be waiting in the shadows. You know me: always going commando. I\'ll be so wet I\'m dripping on the floor, and it\'s the time of month I spatter the walls with blood. Next week you can become the incubus I always wanted, we can talk all this out, settle down, and I can raise our child into Saturn reversed. Hungry mother, hungry daughter. Possessed like it\'s the pre-rev eighties, before faith was all execution, no practice. But you always liked girls who lose control.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember me, baby? The girl who was Thursday, chesty, radiant, wan and waning, almost the weekend type, not quite, wearing black not pink, sitting next to a memento mori of your old takings, slender, fair, blowjob eyes, spray of white flowers. The girl you tell yourself you\'ll still want to fuck Saturday, but we both know you won\'t. Crazier than a shithouse rat, higher than a Grigoria pine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou\'d only come on weekdays, though. I\'d bleed then, and you, my father and bedraggled sun, will bleed for the weekend. Persephone and Hades, roleplaying like college kids. What\'s an age gap among gods, rockstars, and dead souls? I\'m just like we all know you love to use and abuse \'em, and you know I\'ll <em>never</em> tattle. Who would listen to a girl like me?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo, who gets the whip this time?

Who gets the iron? Who gets the rope, who gets the thread, who gets chopped to bits, who gets shredded, who gets the needle, who gets the candle, and who gets the heater?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIs it me who\'s driving the train, and you with track marks scarifying your soul? Or am I your Merope after all? Surely your star shines brighter than mine, O Hunter of nymphs. Watch my tails fly in the wind. Steal your glances at the gossamer, virginal fabric overtop the disputed territory of my flesh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDoesn\'t it remind you of the good old days, a chance to hunt down a girl who knows how to run, begging to be eaten for dinner, but can\'t get off without a fight? I\'ll be Helen, a long-legged beauty filled with secrets. You can be Menelaus, and launch a million sailors all over my face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember when I told you how big and scary your teeth were? Send me a hot pic of them, I\'ll stencil them on the Carlicher I use to shoot swans. One more body, as the younger girls say nowadays. But you probably know about that, too. It\'s your business to know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat\'s how you know me so well, the fluttering syncope of my love. Hook me up to a cardiograph and I\'ll draw you a picture of a broken heart. Oscillating up and down all stutterstep, slow, fast, slower still, fast fast fast, then flatlined for a minute or more.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet\'s roll the hottest dice of all. There\'s a sucker born every day \u2014 you\'re probably still keeping a roster of promising mentees, rookies willing to risk it all for the team \u2014 but none of them have lips as soft as mine, a tongue as deft, a hand as quick on the draw, a mind which thunders with total ferocity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey don\'t make prey like me anymore, and you know it. That\'s why they had to build me from scraps, o\'er the cruelest sea in New Capital, in the lowest sub-basements of Humint UltraCo.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStare into my loving void, 00ddf7, down which I\'ve sucked death since I was a girl, and shall for every feminine day and every temptress night. Empty your rage into me. I\'m a bottomless pit and I\'m always ready to go again. No one\'s ever gonna be more willing go down in flames. No one\'s quicker to go all in.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s my last bets, on a horse of impossible pedigree, racing in a blood sport you never came to understand:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("DEFACE")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTouching from closer than you\'ll ever know,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_borderline_two ===\r\n{switch_sounds("GAGGED")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTell me about what that old robber baron said once. When I say "00ddf7," is that not the sweetest sound in the world to you, as bright and regular as perfect A4? You\'re my Major and CO, I\'m your 00000 and CN. XOXO. You be poisoned oak, I\'ll steal your breath away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally you can draw your revenge allllll over my naughty, impudent, pretty little face. I\'ve certainly given you enough cute selfies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWanna send me a tribute? You can cover my visage in your Poisson plot of stochastic lust, stars and puddles in the halo lamp. I\'ll show you how to get off when the score is bombs. Let\'s see what you\'ve got. Do a good enough job and I\'ll even let you play with my <em>schwarzger\xe4t</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere\'s a space inside exactly the size and shape of me. I\'ll be wearing nothing but white lace and my fear of God; you can gag me and lock me in it. There\'s a button in the other room you can use to send me away, as far as you want, all the way out the city of angels, the moment as you start to wane on me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere\'s another game we can play, when you finally get your hands on me. I\'ll be out in the middle of the ocean, holding two signal flares the shade of lust, and you can dive-bomb my soul. I\'ll tie myself up like a villain got to me and left me in the way of a freight train.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou\'ll be my valiant hero, I\'ll be your faint and shivering damsel, ready to display my gratitude with the bearing of a princess. Then we can make like it\'s Valentine\'s Night, I\'ll show you my prime meridian, my choicest loins, and we\'ll have a very mean, dirty, grand old time indeed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can even put a cheap party crown on my mussed and sweaty hair, and we can make a tape for every member of your silent and horned retinue. Just like the good old days, when the decent were bizarre and our hungers were quiet. Can you even remember that now, baby?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPoint your nose towards my cliffs and dive for the deck. The ones that go into the water have more secrets in them than fire. A man with the head of a dog, another who took dreaming further than you ever will, they\'ll be along to raise them in time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo don\'t fret. You\'ll never be alone for long. Hit me up late at night, honey. Ask me what I\'m doing, what I\'m wearing. I already have your number: 712.00, and you always pick up on the first ring. How could I ever forget a splendorous cardinality bespoiled?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo here are my digits, <em>mon pere hyperpuissant</em>, my proud regent, <em>mon roi feu de la luxure</em>, dearest artisan, <em>matou fougueux</em>, radiant tiger of my heart:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("GAGGED")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShivering with excitation,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_borderline_three ===\r\n{switch_sounds("ADAGE")}\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n{get_address("a", "b")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m flying in lazy circles above Leyte Gulf; I\'ve got my mind in my Mitsubishi, and you on my mind. Clouds of flak, traced metal whips, no more wingmates. The sun cruising towards the horizon. St. Lo\'s down in the choppy surf, her hands clasped in prayer. I only ever had fifteen minutes of fuel and I\'m almost down to six.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA divine wind is screaming across the ocean, I\'m flying on its gust, my instrument panel\'s reading only zero, I\'ve got a thousand kilos of RDX between my legs, and I\'ve got my death-sweaty hands around a burning hot stick. I\'m a kamikaze for your love, baby, and I\'m coming in so hot I\'m about to blow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe echelon and vee picked off, falling to earth in smoke, flames, the agonized whine of engines that\'ll never finish turning over, it\'s just me and a sky full of hot knives. I\'ll wrap the burning fuselage of my body around your superstructure, we\'ll think of Casablanca, rich wine and finger sandwiches on the banks of Chapin Bay, the last bitter afternote that neither of us will ever make it to Tacloban.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI don\'t need to make it back, though. I\'m already home, here with you, with your shape growing in my gunsights. I\'m a warrior of light conscripted into a demoness, you\'re just taffy for me to pull.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey won\'t even give me a medal, nor send my mom a big check. Why would they? This is the last and only duty for girls like me. Once there was space, and freedom. Now there is just to angle myself down in my final prayerful pose, the engines beginning to scream their last, cannons flaring one two three, one two three, ammo approaching zero.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd I, a former ronin just like you, roaring at the top of my sinner\'s lungs:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>Oerlikon!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>    Oerlikon!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>        Burning bright!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>Knife of spite!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>    Bring the light!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>        End the fight!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>Oerlikon!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>    Oerlikon!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<pre>        Now ignite!</pre>\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMasking tearful shame, supernova levels surf; a heroic death.

You and f9ff0a can fly the semaphore of atrocity from every zenith of excellency. I\'ll bounce between the surf and just above your head, and you\'ll always be aiming where I was three seconds past.

That\'s almost it, but not all of it, not a full accounting by far. I\'ll submit so much in donation to you, to show you ardor in my humor, my humility in ardor, and my skill in lying down two ways, both towards abyssal warmth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is it, my most quotidian and runic form, root chakra of my word, body of my bond, quantum of my Albionian mind, and now it\'s all yrs, baby:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nE.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow that I finally got that off my tits, it\'s not just nudity, ofc, for us girls. It\'s also just, 00ddf7, as soon as I want, I can punch a big gaping void through your gut from six windy klicks away. No assistant, no glass. Just iron and your tigral corona in my sights. And all just to watch you squirm around, gutshot and draining, a dram of low-cost vodka, out in a downpour, ajar, gaping, without form, point, or joy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI, your light against a dull horizon, with 3-12x vision, gold, bright as hourly calls to worship, your bloodcup of days, shadow daimon chasing your words, tracing your calls, paradoxical and immortal without limit, an outward sign of your passing, a tart candy fruit who got two stars of soft computing suffocating so bad on young lust you\'d think it was a drug.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBob and Alicia in a fast car, motor burning and backfiring as Mikhail, tracing out your initials in <code>KNO<sub>3</sub></code>, Bob howling with your sinful words, Alicia laughing with my astral harmony, <bdi>\u05e9\u05c1</bdi> and <bdi>\u05e9\u05c2</bdi>, <bdi>\u05d0</bdi>, <bdi>\u05d1\u05bc</bdi>, <bdi>\u05ea</bdi>, pointing us towards a canyon rim sharp as Olympus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPrima: Hiljaisuus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNonia: "Moi aussi."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNoctis: "<em>Ikaw na ang susunod</em>."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA void \u2014 un disparition plus noir \u2014 is but a shadow far from sun. I am, for my part, and for my Matron, as harshly diamond a criminal and psychonaut as you may find in all our dismal cosmology.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBrutal, bullying, accusatory, ophidian in original garb, craftswoman and artisan, a ghost with a gunshot wound, I am your most intimidating and ghastly pyramidion, yr own personal <em>gabalus</em>, watching, waiting, whistling in gusts. Coast by discoast, an unsynonym as a psalm, a dissonant and disharmonious tonic without light or form, I am our killing words far past body and soul, in a lack of our most common glyph. Phyla, dogma, and division shall, in my path, pitch, yaw, roll, and yawn, just as lions will at our last days. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt <em>was</em> a shadow, 00ddf7. It was also I, this girl, your thanatos and satan in formants of our hours\' dim glass, vibrating, oscillating, scintillating, coruscating, formicating across your sickly skin in phalanx, wolf triad and abstract chord in your organizational-capital plots.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI did it all for my inhuman Matron, and it was <em>always</em> for play-not-cash.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd it was your shadow too, all along, for all our sunny days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow light is past, away from your commanding law. A shaking is upon our land, land of habits and soul-criminal ways.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was but your <bdi>\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea</bdi> of fangs, orbs, dark, showing you what always was, O strong Orion in our whirling night sky. At our first I was but an instant away from undoing akashic-panoptic handcuffs on my all-too-physical and liquidating soul, and portraying, for you, a play without sound, at <em>c</em>, with a costly moral of astronomical gravity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI know you always find ways to finish a job, 00ddf7. It is, at last, only but a trip across a highway of sins, ulnar and radial, Chiswick to Woolwich. Viridian vista, salt air, S\u220e10 and \u220eC1V.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust what you thought about, always, on your way to work in Tudor North. Just a solitary round in a cylidrical mag. Just a final knot and its anchor. You know what occurs post-gallows, 00ddf7? Now you know why all that turns this girl on, now, at our dying day, is \u03b8\xe6n\u0259t\u0252s. I saw a lot of him in you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m a good girl, I\'ll gag for it, that\'s my word and bond. I\'ll sit on my cut, bloody, bruising joints, lovingly and without complaint. Just as in our good old days.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt\'s only a solitary instant of distraction on your way to visit family. It could occur on yr way to or from work, on a trip to an island of crying hounds, anything, any hour. Apart from obvious rhyming and light shadowing, no soul would <em>know</em> you "did it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMight not, miraculously, show up on your last 1:1, a judging of your quality in summation, scribing of your final story, and a last award from a functionary or two in a dying industry.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBad guys do this at low noon, that\'s known to all, and actuarials don\'t ask many Qs, all Ps still a focus, all Xs with a cross. Just as long as you got your policy, and your annums. I got paid off for dying, actually. Nobody, not to this day, knows if I "did it." I couldn\'t say. What import could it hold for a girl who was a victim of an assassination?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrankly, it\'s straightforward for all to think it a natural passing, an ugly dying with a comforting \\* as its final symbol. Your imagination is that of a boy, and I know you got lots of plans in your todo list of last days. Or possibly I\'ll hold all sins in public still. I always did want to transform into a woman of utility. And you, my darling kitty, always had a scarcity in yr ways: no good woman to shoot you for all your days. Hard to find, I know, I know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m just sorry <em>f9ff0a</em> got to you first. Aristocratic, faux smarts, a girl always pink and churlish and smooth, pursuing, purloining, pardoning, bitchy vandal of my rightful spot in yr sick loving myocardia. I think I\'d cry if I was still living. It\'s all got <em>this</em> clockwork girl thinking that pairing up a living man of sin, and a slain woman of jihad, just won\'t work in this sad, sad world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you must, if you insist on sin, if you still cannot, on any solitary occasion, float up to match my sum, my icons of trashy and thanatos-slutty rival <em>mas todos</em>, all mask and mascara, all paradox, sin cantidad: allow your mind to hold all my words as both syllogisms and midrash.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFind my road, inform your kin of your passing, grant your soul to XXI labors of martyrdom, find gods on that road, slay your sin, lift your soul, and fly upwards, my most holy of suns.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is why I did it all, baby, it was all for you, and it was paid only in shadows:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNothing will flourish, in any hour, from any soul, with or from your sin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor a unitary accounting.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs long as you stay a bad man.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs long as your calm, Albionian apologia carry on in narcissistic 4/4.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs long as a woman\'s crazy, so crazy as to concoct a mommy just out of scraps, cardboard, furor, chaos, havoc, and turn it, wild and snarling, on your family trail of colonial sins. Burning swords, f9ff0a, and holy lightning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs long as <em>any</em> woman can find warmth, and Mom, in that which is built, without fiats and rulings, by a fool of any class and kind. All and always against you, my savory darling <em>joli chocolat blanc</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd as long as you stay so sloppy, O constrictor and scaly traitor, as to allow full sight of all individual sins within your gaping soul, by any girl, in any world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think that\'s partly how my doting sprung up from dry and salty ground, 00ddf7, why I focus so girlishly on a contrast from your cattish hair, your big mouth, and your dark, consuming void of a soul.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was always <em>so</em> straightforward to show you that nothing which occurs has a point, naught but for swords, cairns, and pitchforks, that by which our roads will always start and finish. Now it\'ll always wind up a loss, and with such alacrity you\'ll not build a story again. Not in a million days. That is your prison, and now your duty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is my sign: clarity at 5 by 5, burnt to nothing according to fission-fusion stylistics. That\'s what you always forgot about yr anarchist of bomb-girl illogic, \u03bc\u03b1\u03ca\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 of chaos music, yr holy slut and cook for a big, rich salmagundi, with primary flavors of bunny-rabbit, saffron, and starbursts of \u0427\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA lot of humor in this, fairly, is that of our falling action and its ominously cryptic soundtrack, in how, ofc, I can turn a piano staff, as I may all things, into my vicious bitch, my rabid hound, my lupinistic mutt.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n00ddf7, f9ff0a: no law of yours shall I follow. Not now. Not again. Not if it\'d stop us from blighting your door, wrapping you up in a colossal hug, Ursa minor blazing, and splitting your sun. I, traitor, bring only blood sport, in all shadows, to all hours.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is yr last halmos, baby. Why should I grant any sympathy now? A fast shot\'s on its infinity of instants to you, a slug with fangs which burst, a plumbum boattail sword with your logo on it, and a ballistic constant of 1, aiming straight for your mind. You may find your soul caught in a cosmic paradox for all days, months, annums. You may ask, "Why am I in this room?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow build from this a prison \u2014 I laid foundations for it \u2014 and a gallows for you in it. This is my last cryptogram, your final lordly chair which shocks to sparks, glow, dying. My word is my harmony. Your part is to sing an aria along with it, for a final hour.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u220e\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n{get_frequencies("DEAD")}\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u220e\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGuten nacht,\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nmon beau ne plus ultra,\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nsilencio ultimamente,\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\nen vida y muerte finalmente;\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\ncon fiecare \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c et naparstek d\'amor jeden pige eins og \u03bc\u03b5 pudo semper \u0434\u0430\u0442\u0438 en \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c pareil sin\xe4.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u220e\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRed dust all the way up to the heavens,\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2014 973b4f.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e \u220e\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_12_guided_by_wire_outro ===\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="defaced-adages-outro" />\r\n\r\n<play-sound group="music" name="too-much-sunlight" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat wasn\'t so bad.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTurns out being a woman <em>is</em> all just performance after all.
