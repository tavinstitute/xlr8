Firearms and hypodermics rise like signal flares and are self-administered by the Finders\' fragile hands. Their minds are grave wax, rich and buttery. Glad songs follow them to their end, too high for mortal ears to love.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow the children are become a dagger of the mind, perfectly sharp and drawing to an infinitesimal tangent. Now they slice health and sanity like tranches, approaching minimal limits of breadth.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow all the plateaux and deserts of the incisive watcher soul are dropped into the feed trough of the unreal.\r\n\t</p>\r\n* You walk through the ward door.\r\n\t<stop-sound group="music" name="shut-em-down" />\r\n\r\n\t<play-sound group="music" name="epiphany" />\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tYou see yourself as lighter than atoms, a quantum dancer, a chef\'s knife forged of twilit quarks. You slice through the door as through tofu. The brick remains ignorant to a measureless transection. The children pass in the same no-space you traveled.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThrough the facility you rage like hungry ghosts, spectral, invisible, protoplasmic. The good boys and girls of the deep state are ready for a ten-course dinner after years of obedience.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tAt first They are mystified.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThey walk monster-faced and oxygenated, rebreathing clinically sterile molecules, clad in bulletproof hazmat.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThrough the ward They patrol, watchers of the magical children.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThe ward is empty, in all wavelengths and sight, of magical children. The sole evidence the experiments were there recently: the leavings of a food fight.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThe trammelled ones unbind further from the real.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow They begin to disappear, one quantum sup after another. The space between electrons, the bright and negative voids like cocoa around the atomic nougat, all fragrantly delicious, down to the irreducible mole.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tFive infinitesimal mouths open to reveal 602214080000000000000000 teeth apiece.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThe guards and Their managers fall apart, just like dolls whose every stitch has come undone at once.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tOnly strings are left in the wake of Their devouring.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow the Gamecaller comes over the leylines, stern and godly. The chief seer of the Finders will peer beyond sight and form to find the children who would snack in darkness.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tEven as crumbs of matter you can hear him, each of you in novel rings, producing new physics with each bite.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t"Children."\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tDaddy Marion speaks with the authority of a man for whom every game is won, around whom every rule is bound, who has learned and sought to love his voice as called over wire.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tBut you are the fathers of women, the mothers of men, those who beget the future and inherit the past. You may cheat whenever you please.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow you are traveling along infinities of time and space, a long road spanning no days and negative kilometers, small feet on the gas pedal, nearing the vanishing point. Strange is your bread; charmed is your wine.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tInside the Gamecaller it is dark and you are lightless suns. Five gray rats crawl up a table leg in the immanent delicatessen. The number is five, and soon it will be <em>i</em>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThe experimental wolves are now pups, smaller than any embryo or bacterium.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tReality flickers as an incendiary cloud. Each particle is white-hot, a black-body radiator beyond body or blackness.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThe milk of that which is. Warm and soporific.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n    Now you are attached to the teat of spacetime.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow the tablecloth of reality unwinds as you draw the very ducts out of the breast of the world.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow the plate is finally clean; now the children may nap.\r\n\t</p>\r\n* You let the darkness take you.\r\n\t<stop-sound group="music" name="shut-em-down" />\r\n\r\n\t<play-sound group="music" name="henny" />\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tYou fall into bedding softer than the fabric of the deathworlds, quieter than heat death viewed remotely. Isness tastes of almond, a sumptuous tart, a bedtime snack, and the afternote is an echo reaching toward nothingness. Then it is not.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tYou drift into dream realer than life, of a boy made like you, a Solulos among the hundreds, and a girl unmade into faith. In her you spend a thousand eons, a tiny star orbiting a hypermassive black hole, Rip van Twinkle for a denuded clockwork universe, populated by none.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t-> yield ->\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tInside your dream you sleep, and inside that sleep you dream for lightyears. You dream yourself a hero, a leader of those unsatiated beyond the zero, a fierce imaginary constant in an equation which demands to be real. Every brick and cell is devoured. When the feast is done, you allow yourselves to be consumed by the artistry of hunger itself, something evolved so far past life as to disdain it as irrelevant to the question of existence.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tNow you are become one. Now you are even less.
