On the mirror of her pupils, I\'m not Hank anymore. I\'m Mother. I have her face, her body, her frown, and all her ways. Nothing of Henry seems to remain.\r\n    </p>\r\n* I look at the digital calendar.\r\n    <p>\r\n    I strain to read the words on the calendar. The display is three meters away, and there\'s a floodlight in my eyes.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is written in words and numerals I do not recognize, just odd symbols where there should be the names of months and days. But the datestamp is Arabic, and reads just fine. It\'s clearly wrong, though:\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n    <code><time>13.09.2300</time></code>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    <time>13 September, 2300</time>. That\'d be nearly two years since I arrived. Which was at the end of February. In a different century, at that. I don\'t even recall two weeks since then. So it must have broken since the last time I was in this room.\r\n    </p>\r\n* I try to ask, "How long?"\r\n    <p>\r\n    Nothing speaks, not even me.\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_00_interlocution ===\r\n<p>\r\nYears later, I arrive at the form of speech.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"How many days have I been here?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThree instances of the same paternal voice over the loudspeaker, each speaking in harmony.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* "Two quadrillion, four hundred trillion days."\r\n* "You\'ve been here forever."\r\n* "Just one. The last."\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow, finally, Mother opens her mouth to speak.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat pours out is brighter than the high-watt lamp sucking water out of my face, louder than a shotgun, warmer than an IV of metafent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_00_parable_of_the_game ===\r\n<p>\r\n"Let\'s start with a parable, shall we?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* "Yes."\r\n* "No."\r\n* ["..."]\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Say you\'re at a casino."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt takes a second to remember the sort of game that involves money.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I\'m at a casino."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Yes, you are. It\'s the biggest you\'ve ever been inside. Card tables, players, dealers, cocktail girls, and security guards, stretching as far as the eye can possibly see. Everything smells like chicken, nicotine, and sweat. What game do you wager on? Twenty-one?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* "Blackjack."\r\n    <p>\r\n    "A good choice among those which can only lead astray. Twenty one is the number, and bankruptcy is the game."\r\n    </p>\r\n* "Roulette."\r\n    <p>\r\n    "Spin the wheel, predict the future. Just remember every fantasy you ever had of playing red and black until you squeeze a run of luck out will, in due time, be ruined by green."\r\n    </p>\r\n* "Craps."\r\n    <p>\r\n    "A clever choice. The only one which truly involves skill, and one could conceivably hack at its source. Unfortunately no better than any other choice. But remarkably precise, despite my leading question."\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShit. I was sure I\'d at least get this one right. After all this time, I should be good at losing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother interrupts me to remind me the rules of operation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"There you are, drink in hand, blood oozing with a dismal glow. You are in the hall of speculators. The hall of money-changing is to the west. Before you, to the north, is the Table, and the Dealer. Every game has a dealer, every game has a player.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou realize, after several losses, that the dealer is cheating. How he does so is immaterial. It just matters that he cheats, that when he cheats, he winks to the guard, and in several rounds more you note the same pattern at every table in view. Like bees on comb, vibrating together in a sinus hardly more orderly than chaos."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI can feel the gears of my mind seizing and struggling to catch up. Clearly I\'m still the loser in this scenario. Same as earlier. Same as it ever was.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"By now you know, or should, that you cannot win. Not merely by \'playing\' the game, not by respecting the rules, never by grievance or progress. Even if the dealer allows you to win moderate sums, you\'ll trend negative almost immediately, and soon go bust. There\'s no point in complaining, no one to complain to, and even if there were, they\'d just tell you it\'s all what you signed up for when you came to the casino. He has no reason to let you leave with anything but empty pockets and accounts, unless you seem especially stupid, and he falls for a wild bet. What do you do?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* "Find a tell, get a win, cash out."\r\n    <p>\r\n    "Too random, too obvious. Best-case you win enough money for a bag of the good stuff and they give you a new dealer. This strategy has to work longer than six games."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    * * "I\'d find a casino that didn\'t cheat."\r\n        <p>\r\n        "You cannot. It is the only casino, the only building, on the only land. It stretches on farther than you may ever walk, and will never be allowed to leave."\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>\r\n        "Oh."\r\n        </p>\r\n    * * "Oh."\r\n    * * "..."\r\n* "Cheat better than the dealer."\r\n    <p>\r\n    "No. This would allow you to beat the dealer, perhaps, if you became a skilled enough cheater. But doing so, you are noticed as a pattern. Every bit of currency, abstract or real, is tracked, every table is watched by armed men, a thousand digital eyes penetrate every wavelength, a million digital neurons see your intents before they occur to you, every atom is valuated and convertible to credits, all is under the control of the Owner of the House, and you can\'t ever cheat well enough beat the system. That, as a lesson, may be taken to refer to the general or specific you."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "Okay."\r\n    </p>\r\n* "Make myself seem stupid?"\r\n    <p>\r\n    "You truly are self-assured even in ignorance, palindrome child of my image. It is admirable. Brave, even. It reminds me of my grandmother. That\'s what drew me to you, of course.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    But, sadly, stupidity is not at all what this situation needs. Every fool has her day, but if she spends it at the casino, she leaves wise only in the ways of theft, and rich only in her brokenness.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    And even when stupidity succeeds as battle \u2014 let us never suggest it a dull sword \u2014 it loses quickly in the wartime algebra of big numbers."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    I\'m not sure I grasp her meaning, but she knows this. She is my Mother. She knows all.\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"And so there is one winning strategy in the fortress of odds and its theoretical games. Your objective \u2014 the right answer, the <em>only</em> answer \u2014 is to steal all the chips, flip the table, shoot the dealer, and burn down the casino."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_00_revelation ===\r\n<p>\r\nYes. This, too, washes over me as revelation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUncountable time passes in the fortress of my mind. Torches burn.

Yes.\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI open the portal of my mind, greet my matron at the door, and consume the radiant noon sun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I want you to visualize yourself in many times and places at once. Can you do that?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYes. I can see a thousand placetimes arranged in an intricate prism.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Remember a time when you lost all your friends."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYes. I am 14 and I have offended in ways I cannot bring myself to regret. It\'s night and we\'re walking under the bridge. Everyone is starting to walk a bit faster than me. There\'s just the slightest bit of dew on the grass. The concrete is blank and spotless.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Remember a time when you were betrayed by your best friend.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember a time when you disappointed your sibling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember a time when you broke a bond with someone who died or left, which you can never repair.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember when men forced you to stand in a certain place, in a certain way, silently, and conveyed dark consequences if you failed to be obedient.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember waking up terrified and inconsolable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRemember something you failed to say.
