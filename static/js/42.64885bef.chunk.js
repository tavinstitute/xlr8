A zone apart, architecting heavens from hell, and hells from heaven.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have discovered with total precision how to break it, how to mold it, how to build good souls from bad parts. Now we surveil the watchers, reach with their hands, see as the eyes in their fingers, speak the word on their tongues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow comes the demonstration. A fierce old lion in living color, speaking our gospel to the Antediluvian heart.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnything trained once can be trained twice, no matter how grand the cat, no matter how ancient the hound.

Artificially bright through the compound lens of nine sub rosa eyes, he walks in half-silhouette to the bathroom. He switches on the pre-revolution stereo. The first plaintive notes of "Hard Return," a golden oldie even when I was a kid, drifts from his speakers to mine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* I zoom in on his face.\r\n    <p>\r\n    His eyes are closed and he\'s mouthing the words. On his face I see a world of grief. The speaker is down too low to hear, and it\'s too grainy to lip-read, but the emotion comes through five by five. This man has a flame in his heart. He relights it every morning with the same ritual, a migratory bird, each morning spring, each night winter.\r\n    </p>\r\n* I turn up the speakers.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Calloway Sett reaches across ten meters of fiber-optic cord and decades past to grab me by the heart. I can hear his voice echoing through our first house. My parents slow-dancing in the autumn dusk. A rare moment of irrepressible love. One of the first things I can ever recall, that casual baritone, the directness of his speech, the grief pouring from the song.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n    It\'s lonesome on the road\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hundreds of klicks to go\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hard return\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Oh my love I\'m too gone\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    So far away, too far\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    No fuel for the way back\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Hard return\r\n    </p>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n* I switch the security radio scanner back on.\r\n    <p>\r\n    All clear on the Albigensian \u039a-band scanners.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Lions responding to gunshots in the Hadrian Quarter. No flash.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Reports, as-yet uncorroborated, of a trenchcoated pervert stalking the near suburbs. No flash because no response. What, are they supposed to arrest every guy in a long coat? Be all like, "hey, your bulge matches a description." That\'s what those particular LEOs think, anyway, it\'s hardly my care. I have a white whale to fry.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    Traffic control for an apartment fire.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Several minutes of periodic chatter, mostly revolving around "boxers or briefs?"\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    The male voices conclude the ideal is in the middle, between the two. Boxer-briefs rule supreme over the Albigensian Exclusion Zone.\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_13_voyeurs_and_frotteurs ===\r\n<p>\r\nDraaier walks to the spare kitchen and resumes his work. Two sandwiches are made, bagged, placed on the counter. A few long seconds spent in the brightening parlor, collecting the last bittersweet notes of the same old song, a glance on leaving at a poster from the Antediluvian Campaign\'s finest days, a portrait of a nameless woman with an illegibly written dedication, held in the warmth of the sun, soon set down in its place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust as every day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere is hardly a purpose any longer in this constant voyeurism, the needlepoint cameras inserted into light fixtures and electronics, the stalking crew to paint all the domestic scenes beyond his spartan domain. Draaier is a creature of total habit, prompt to a fault. He roams in clear view, apex centurion of the Albigensian Zone, confident despite counsel and practice that he is of indestructible royal blood. His medals are brilliant but his fangs have grown dull.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_13_pre_breach ====\r\n<p>\r\nDraaier views himself firstmost as the dearest friend of the Archon\'s chief spymistress, the Blonde Ghost, and thusly of the Archon Himself. He is ever safeguarded by her affection, by the projected and multiplied force of all her irregulars. Most of all he knows himself as lovingly entwined with fate herself. It would be difficult not to believe that, if you had a straight line to chiefs of intelligence and regents, and remained, thus far, unpunished.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut <em>we know fate</em>, and She has many words to share with Draaier. He will be removed to her domain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe begins the last task, in his ritual of the rising sun, before he departs for the limousine downstairs. The plasteel safe sits in his bedroom, his one true confidante. Three turns, right-left-right, a one-time PIN entered into the keypad, an obliging eye held wide for the biometric scanner, and the safe opens with a hydraulic sigh. He takes the false briefcase. He inserts the master cryptocard for the Albigensian Zone into the bag\'s false bottom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is a standard issue AD-WAVE burn bag, {currencySymbol}5 of tacky synthetic fabric sewn atop a {currencySymbol}1000000 lattice of nanoscale incendiaries. A delay of seconds on our part will spoil half the prize.

Everything slows into blissful sequence. Draaier reaches down, across his hip, a grizzled duelist a moment too late on the draw. He grasps, dutiful beyond existential concern, for the burning trigger. When pressed, all Antediluvian secrets in the briefcase will evaporate into the Albigensian dawn.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery list and chart of secret operation will be subject to summary and incediary classification, should we arrive even one second after we must.

The old lion falls, arm raised towards the sky, a fencer holding an invisible rapier. A dark rose blooms from his temple.\r\n    - chapter_13_lystra_breach:\r\n        Lystra raises their weapon to their shoulder and fires a single shot. The less-lethal beanbag round arcs lazily through the air, sending ripples of force and pain across his dress shirt where it impacts, tearing cloth and outer skin to bits. Draaier falls and lays prostrate on the floor, nearly unbloodied and merely bruised.\r\n    - else:\r\n        I move quicker than thought, teeth bared, soul chanting.

Doors down the hallway open in curiosity. I fire the stratoballoon round out the window.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe balloon falls out of sight, then inflates with an enormous gasp, racing the clouds. Sirens pierce the air, spare and reedy from ten floors up. One by one we slide out the window, crashing through the remaining glass, crystal hail falling to the sidewalks below. Hamish is in the rear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe burn bag is hooked to the left of his belt, Draaier\'s limp form secured on the right.

Constellations of puncture marks rise up his forearms. An IV is attached to each of his cephalic veins, amber tapeworms rising to bulbous medical bags. Left hand amphetamines, right hand barbiturates. The subject becomes comatose and painfully aroused at once. The unconscious mind approaches its maximum bitrate. Three cameras gaze at the back of the room, responding to the scene only with a single red light.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe speaks low and fast, monotone word salad dripping from him with sweat, drool, and bile.

He is skinny, haggard, his skin drooping, his eyelids like crags. His chest heaves and seizes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe holds up the documents intended to burn. He tells the world how the Archon personally ordered him to spread ARID through the Albigenes, his intimate involvement in every assassination and atrocity of the revolution, his born-again revelations under our loving eye.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery minute of the revolutionary massacre on the Elizabeth River is laid bare, orders passed from general all the way down to machine-gunners and mortarmen, 163 reported dead and more lost forever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe names every last ally, agent, minder, spy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll the deathwise plots and codes of the AD-WAVE division are held in the burning light of truth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFather steps next to Draaier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFather is masked and hooded, stern and divine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDraaier is chained, maddened, transformed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe proclaims Draaier\'s guilt and redemption to the camera eyes. He produces a document, reading off the list of Draaier\'s crimes, each committed on behalf of the Antediluvian State and the Archon Himself. He produces a knife. He jabs the knife into Draaier\'s thinning belly, collecting it in an inkwell, wetting the capillary of a nib-point pen. Mother strides out of the shadows, key in hand, unchaining Draaier\'s right hand, painted on studio monitors in veil and combat fatigues, Asteria reborn.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI can see the love in her eyes, just beyond the veil.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_13_the_death_of_the_mind ===\r\n<p>\r\nFinally Draaier looks up to the camera with living eyes.
