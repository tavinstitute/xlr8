Its form seems mutate with every second: now the triad of an eagle\'s claws, now a face and incoherent spatter of noise, now the shape of a lion\'s fangs, now the horns and skull of a rampaging bull, a cognitive overload in nightmarish form.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLystra over comms: "Break! Incoming!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe turrets flare into life, bright lances tracking the two nearest bogeys. Each of them vectors out in a diamond shape. The lance touchest the nearest and it explodes into fragments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Great fucking shot, Lefteris!"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"No getting cocky, now."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGreat blooms of flak like bouquets of thorns behind the chariot. It turns, afterburners flaring. One of the shells explodes directly behind, adjacent the gun turrets. Both turrets cease firing. The ship tilts into a flat spiral.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Engines are down. Ailerons aren\'t responsive.

I\'m heading back to the cockpit to check there."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"My readout shows complete loss of electric and data in the starboard turrets.

Hamish sprints to the aft of the ship to operate both turrets through the ship fire control system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI take the co-pilot seat next to Salome. As soon as the cushion, cold and fragrant, presses into my neck, I see an entire intricate web of data, like city lights as they receded in our last view of Earth\'s glow. Never gonna see that little blue marble again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBest-laid plans curdle into the world\'s final suicide mission. Data fires into my retinae, blinding and total.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHamish sends flaming whips at our pursuers. One flashes to dust in the dark. Each spirals outwards in sine waves of decreasing frequency, whirling towards us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI speak the perfect truth of what is to come:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Incoming. Break right. Prepare for impact."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNearby detonations. Turbulence. Three shells penetrate the aft, detonating inside the turret bay. All turret systems disappear. Hamish vanishes from the display.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore shots tracking closer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"INCOMING. BRACE FOR IMPACT IN COCKPIT SECTION."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEvery quantum of my vision fills with burning white. Every data point is fire. Every datum is injury. I can feel Salome slip out of control, then out of the Group entirely. She is gone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"SALOME KIA.
