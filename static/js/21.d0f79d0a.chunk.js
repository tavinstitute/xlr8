No more dreams too weird to have except in the stalest hours of darkness. No more window shopping. No ordering packages that would only ever look like presents for someone else.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere, no alarms and no words, just the murmurations of machines.

The wind drives nettles of chill up my nose but the fields still manage to smell of death which does not die and lurks. A wolf howls beyond the treeline.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\'m standing atop the bell tower staring down at the refectory. The abbot is here next to me. I\'m wearing only a threadbare frock I cut into a dress and I\'m telling him about the heresy of the future. The last form of God as he will exist in the world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\'Matteo,\' he starts.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\'Matthea,\' I interject.

A disease of hatred far darker than this, the same that swept away the high Albigeneses.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis pause is long enough for the abbot. He slams into my back, and I go tumbling over the rail. As I fall, twisting lazily in the air, I cast one last smile up at him. I\'ll be so far above him in a few minutes I\'ll just appear to be a daytime star.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe heretics will win, a hundred generations later or more, and my death changes nothing at all. This much I promise you, Abbot Cuthbert: illness and isolation alike, when scaled to universal size, will render bodies the least of all your faithful worries. I\'ll see you at the end of ends.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen a sharp halt rearranges my body across the frozen soil. My eyeballs spring out, rolling to a halt in the snow, gazing upwards at a winter sky the color of bone, waiting to be consumed or hidden in the pocket of a rough habit. It does not matter anymore. I am moving from the deathlands at divine speed, towards the arms of the first tree."\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_03_spyi_memory ===\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n"There\'s a robot here with me, far too advanced for the Antediluvian State.

Now I am walking into the cafeteria. Now the patchwork girl is before me, mirrorshades and pushup bra, holding a banana like it were a gun. A truly comical sight in this hall of manufactured evils.

Now I am rising towards the arms of the Archon. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is from his binding grasp that I watch the fake funeral on the entertainment station, a fake family, lilacs, white roses, asters like a whole forest.
