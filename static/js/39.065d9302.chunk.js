Blood is starting to drip into my eyes now that I\'m not flying against the wind. Trail of red behind me. And just now, in the distance, the roar of a r-wing hurtling across the sky and doubtlessly filled with local riot control, a fireforce of Swords encounter specialists, Commando Aleph "advisors."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMother\'s voice is a lullaby. "Hannah. Are you with me?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Mother. I have you five by five."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Walk. One foot in front of the other.

Pushing my good shoulder through crowds, smearing blood across suits and habits, baring my teeth. I am at the platform, and there is no train. Murmurs and shouts. I jump down and land wrong. A sprain, or maybe just an ache. Screams, fading. The crisp bark of loudspeakers. The extreme authority of the synthesized voice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"This station has now been closed.

Barely any signal. Shouldn\'t be more than 50 meters more to an access hatch, and then above it, the exfil zone. Above that, the TAV r-wing. Above all, Source. View the path to come. Ladder should be just ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStarting to feel weak; probably look pale and terribly ill. Whatever.

Exquisite pain of nerves dying. Somehow I hold on, and my good hand stays shielded.

The man on the asphalt trembles incoherently, and begins to crawl away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDraw knife from back sheath. Cut shirt off, wrap around laceration on wrist of "good" hand. Return knife to sheath, compress laceration with bad hand. Another bullet goes right past my head, maybe through the tip of my ear.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGlass careening around the cabin and shallowly lacerating flesh. Aim for soft wall or embankment at the exfil zone and slam the throttle forward. Wrap the seat belt around body immediately before crash. Face goes straight into the wheel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSpit teeth onto the dashboard.
