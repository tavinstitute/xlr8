What\'s your name, you\u2014"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe sound of room tone and tense breathing, growing increasingly labored. The strangled register of sudden awareness, as fatal quantities of MTTX enter his bloodstream through the remote-kill device nestled in his hindbrain. His throat begins to close off and blood pours from the alcoves of his eyes. I can only assume this transpires, at least, given we\'re on an audio-only line. Sometimes imagination must suffice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"It\'s almost over now," I say, but he already knew that by his gooseflesh and narrowing vision. Once the incantation has been delivered, all else is prologue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hear a thump, a rough shiver knocking something onto the floor, then line noise again, pure and barely audible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis pattern recurs again and again, the online status indicators of each of the prime Archontics winking out as I utter the magic words. Aleksandr may notice this, or he may not.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresently he enraptures his audience.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his specialty, the moneymaker. One of his evangelical yet tender developer diaries. Live, in-the-flesh, with studio audience piped in from the matrix, hold your questions to the end, I\'ve left plenty of time no matter how I natter on, etc. etc., <em>ad nauseam</em>. Whatever concern or curiosity incubating now within his tender, brilliant mind remains wholly behind the mask.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA burner account on his streaming platform of choice, combined with a targeted exploit package, gives me access a vulnerability to a free deluxe account that slots me in four spots from the front of the VIP queue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll that remains is waiting for three high-credit contributors to the crowdfunding campaign to ask their most profound questions of Aleksandr.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe speaks for several minutes about his upcoming games, <em>Joktan</em> and <em>Belisarius</em>. As yet unreferenced in the press, the mere mention of these projects is a reward for hungry devotees and renunciants. That he goes on to speak of himself \u2014 plans, hopes, dreams, fears, mistakes, triumphs \u2014 is taken as a sign of total emotional intimacy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe chat barely suppresses its sense of wonder, its urge towards patterns of interrogation and deconstruction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow his eyes, bright and penetrating, speak the language of his soul. When he returns to general questions, the glow fades.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>What\'s the meaning of the Scribe of Division turning against the Prophet of Days? I thought they were supposed to be friends?</li>\r\n    <li>The Scribe of Division, if you recall correctly, dates back to the original <em>Inner Heavens</em> arc. While I can\'t spoil what\'s to come, you may trust his story is not over, and there are many new allegiances, and rivalries, yet.</li>\r\n    <li>Are we ever going to find out what happened to Digital Barabbas? He was my favorite character and then he just disappeared after the chapter with Pseudo-Denise Aropagate!</li>\r\n    <li>You will indeed find out the facts about Digital Barabbas. Soon enough. You may find there is more than one Barabbas, an entire mirror universe of them, marching out of historical sync through the same years, through twisting cities with the same name but no shared maps.</li>\r\n    <li>Can you tell us a bit about your writing process? I guess this part is more of a comment than a question, but I just wanted to say I\'m such a fan of your work, and the way you wrote that romance between Aspirant Lynnea and Chlorest\xe8 Dentata... well, it just made me feel like there was room for people like me in this industry. Sorry for the length \ud83d\udda4!!!</li>\r\n    <li>I am just so glad to hear from a younger fan that I\'ve helped them into this industry. This is a hard place I failed in many times, waiting for success to strike, making half-formed plans and beating them into shape as I sprinted. I\'m especially happy to hear more young women are seeing fit to join the industry. A brief aside for self-advertising, of a sort: we\'re hiring a lead designer at Idea Cavern, and also opening for our second round of mentorships. Those of varied genders and backgrounds are strongly urged to apply. They will find I have learned well in the ways of games, and compassion. Best wishes, Aleksandr.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="psyche-in-the-computer-age" />\r\n\r\n<play-sound group="music" name="rocket-scams" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow Aleksandr hands me the microphone.

He blinks, trying to force his tongue into his well-worn vocational acrobatics. The old topologies of guilt and pride, of antic, casual mendacity, are written across his eyes. Something has changed, though.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere has been a degradation in the machinery, an interference or attenuation, as if his position in time has shifted. New seasons and weather in the land of Johnson, the wind singing implacable tones. Everything begins to stretch like glassed desert.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA blinding and dark eternity marches across his face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe reddens, bleeds, screams. Like he was being smelted, like he was trapped in a hotbed, surrounded by shit and under glass, burning. Then he descends, his forehead careering off the classic rosewood desk, and leaves the frame as an actor for the final time.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="rocket-scams" />\r\n\r\n<play-sound group="music" name="too-much-sunlight" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nExeunt Archontics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI stick around for a few minutes, watching the chat grow rabidly terrified. The platform moderators begin to show up, the chat gets slow-rolled, then halted entirely, and the stream cuts to a vague intertitle. I delete every possible trace of my trespasses and return from one cell, not home, to another cell, home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== yield ===\r\n+ [\u220e]\r\n-\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== done(out_var) ===\r\n{\r\n\t- out_var:\r\n\t\t~ XLR8R_OUT_PASSAGE = out_var\r\n}\r\n\r\n* [\u220e]\r\n-\r\n\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="too-much-sunlight" />\r\n\r\n-> DONE'}}}]);
