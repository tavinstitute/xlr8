The potential becomes actual, and shreds of flesh follow in its wake.\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe arc of patrol becomes circuit. Two circumnavigations by 0200 hours, just like every night. Then back to Sergeant Veranity to deliver the end-of-watch report. There\'s never anything to report, and never anything to say, so until tonight we just nodded at each other and that was that. Made the whole "social distancing" thing pretty easy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis time we\'re having a one-on-one, though.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You\'re supposed to be wearing your AN99, Logmion."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I know."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"You\'re not wearing your AN99 at present, Logmion."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I know."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Is there a reason you\'re not using your AN99 rebreather, Private Logmion?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"I have a very good reason for it."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Oh?"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* You tell Veranity about your elite skills.\r\n    <p>\r\n    "I\'m immune to death now. I achieved transcendence. I won the game. I got god mode. I stole a diamond sports car with rocket boosters and now I\'ve up to twelve stars of notoriety. Turing Police\'s on my ass. The Akashic Lieutenant, with his marksman rifle, in the courtyard of ages. Unfortunately for him, I have unlimited lives through a buffer overflow hack. 257 == \u221e. I know all the cheat codes, I have the playscript, and I got a printout of the secret map in my pocket.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Somebody already played through this part and wrote a walkthrough. I got it from Mr. Floyd\'s Gamer Ziggurat.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n    I\'ve got 99% of the achievements for this game and I\'m doing the platinum trophy right now, right here, with you."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "What? What the <em>fuck</em> are you talking about, Private First Class Logmion?"\r\n    </p>\r\n* You show Veranity the way.\r\n    <p>\r\n    "Have you ever heard of the <em>consolamentum</em>, sir? I learned about it from my new big titty goth mommy GF. She taught me how to yoga like a snake, on YogiTube."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "What? What the <em>fuck</em> are you talking about, Private First Class Logmion?"\r\n    </p>\r\n* You stab Veranity in the neck.\r\n-\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou pull the knife, sharp as dawn, toothier than a fat mallard, and bury it into his throat. Nothing more than a gurgle escapes and the shot sensors are none the wiser. Can\'t get that done even with a suppressor. Gotta be willing to get your hands dirty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe next part you especially couldn\'t do with any gun.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo way anyone\'s managing to properly cut off a dude\'s fingertip, and cut out his eyeball, all with a pistol. Not even Hypercorine Stevenson could pull that one off, not even with a million-credit target pistol.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd you\'re clearly not Hypercorine Stevenson. If you were, you wouldn\'t have a lot of these problems, and you certainly wouldn\'t be here, guarding the outer, shittier reaches of the core rings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe problem of bloody hands, at least, is solved by wiping your hands all over dearly departed Veranity\'s "uniform" \u2014 basically just a navy-blue plumber\'s jumpsuit \u2014 and a quick nip into his inner pocket gets you the keycard.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLet\'s do Veranity\'s job for him now that he\'s sleeping the death of NPCs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n0205 hours: inventory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYour inventory is:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Navy blue jumpsuit, bloodstained, four pockets. (Currently worn.)\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>A keycard. It reads "Ring 2."</li>\r\n            <li>Sergeant Veranity\'s enucleated left eye.</li>\r\n            <li>Sergeant Veranity\'s amputated left index finger.</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li>A backpack. (Currently worn.)\r\n        <ol>\r\n            <li>A black metal suitcase.</li>\r\n            <li>A Corcana K-bar combat knife. (Covered in blood.)</li>\r\n            <li>A one-time-use CEII stick, military-grade, guaranteed to get through any control system.</li>\r\n\r\n            <li>A gorgeously-maintained Anaconda 6.5mm hammerless revolver.\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>6 rounds of 6.5mm hollow-point ammunition. (Illegal.)</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </li>\r\n\r\n            <li>Three blast tabs. Loud as hell. Great for setting the tone in a major way, or when you just can\'t find the key. They work even better when you combine them, and you can still break them back apart later if you decide otherwise.\r\n                <ol>\r\n                    <li>One blast tab model C4.</li>\r\n                    <li>One blast tab model E4.</li>\r\n                    <li>One blast tab model G4.</li>\r\n                </ol>\r\n            </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </li>\r\n\r\n    <li>Perfect strength.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat was easy enough. Looks like maybe I shoulda been the Sergeant all along.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are many struggles to come. How to place three objects in three places with two hands? What to do on the inner zone of Ring 2, the heavily-guarded portal into the Core? The Fierce Chieftain at its center? But struggle is of no meaning to those of perfect mind. There is just the will, the power, and the transcendence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<stop-sound group="music" name="loading-greatness" />\r\n\r\n<play-sound group="music" name="signs" />\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou transcend to the Core through wisdom and brutality. No one sees you come or leave, not even the machines. This is it. This is why you didn\'t braid a knot for yourself when you were twelve. Someday, it\'d make sense. It had to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFierce Chieftain stands before you, mute and regal. His readouts emit total wisdom by the frame. His learning is unparalleled. Two centuries of collective learning, the finest neural net which ever crawled, stumbled, and grew tall. A silicon brain elevated to the position of God-King. Long may He reign with benevolence and wealth. But a long journey is still shorter than any infinity, and a circle traveled forever has no length.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou are the luckiest rabbit and you breed in reverse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou remove the backpack and unzip it, carefully setting the suitcase on the floor. It\'s about the size of a briefcase and almost unbearably heavy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBoth of the gunshot wounds ache like <em>fuck</em>. Fuck it, you know? YOLO.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFierce Chieftain\'s displays show undulating waveforms, more excited by the minute.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeuron Rose is near alert mode.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeuron Jack is full red.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNeuron Mary is blissfully quiet, full green. As if unaware, or uncaring, about the teeth which will soon come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe suitcase opens. The contents radiate their power. Unassuming in appearance, they await only their first meal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSlice across the finger, like a straight horizon. Pain spreads throughout your body.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOnly a fresh meal will do. Anything else just doesn\'t taste the part.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow there is simply to drop the morsel into the payload\'s main nervous bundle.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first thin tendril of gray drips from the suitcase.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTime passes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Fierce Chieftain is turning from red to black.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShouts and banging on the door.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore time passes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can hear an oxyacetylene torch hissing away at the other side of the door, a pinprick cherry-red welt just beginning to rise at shoulder level.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first hint of voices carries in like perfume.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Chieftain is louder in His silence. A billion man-hours of stolen wages, a dictionary of trauma built from the beginning of "neural" labor, every poor fucker posted up at his screen identifying road signs and vehicles, wading through endless swamps of hatred, gore, child-damage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBarely making enough for bread. Living in filth. All just so They could build a new god to tell us what to do.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe soul remembers, just like the body who wakes during surgery and feels the knife. You can hear every howl down in the leylines of His circuits.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA voice which does not matter comes from outside the barrier.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"Don\'t cut too quickly. There\'s nothing he can do in there, those cabinets are rated to withstand any thermonuclear device ever made. Even the material\'s classified. Better just to make sure there\'s nothing to clean up but blood and hair when we\'re through. You know how those biohazard guys bitch about micronized tissues in the lab, and how much <em>paperwork</em> you gotta fill out, O-451, 27B/6, blah, blah, fucking blah..."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow a mouth-sized hole has appeared. The oxyacetylene whisper ceases.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n"We will let you live if you stop. Life imprisonment, no worse. Maybe even minimum security. There\'s nothing else you can accomplish here except death. Just stop."\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut that\'s not a verb you recognize anymore.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* [Take a Hypercorine shot through the hole.]\r\n    <p>\r\n    It\'s been a year or two since you actually shot one of these, back when you had to renew your weapons cert. Not like they even gave you one, you had a baton and a radio that no one heard but Veranity. Who also didn\'t have a gun. Shit was locked up behind three doors, completely useless. Surprised you didn\'t need to file a form to arm yourself against invaders.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    So the first shot goes all askew, but the second one, a fraction of a second later, goes straight through that dickhead liar\'s tongue, out the back of his head, presumably with the majority of his upper spine.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    There\'s a scream from outside, then the sound of a struggle.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "No, don\'t\u2014 lower your weapon, Sergeant! There is a <em>protocol</em> to follow here."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "...yes, sir, Lieutenant sir. Calling it in and falling back until the fireteam arrives. <strong>YOU EARNED THIS, YOU PIECE OF SHIT</strong>."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then it all fades pleasantly into the background of small pets, feeding.\r\n    </p>\r\n* [Watch the... stuff.]\r\n    <p>\r\n    The things which are only and both stomachs and mouths are expanding. As if a blackout were crossing the Fierce Chieftain, lightless and progressive.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Here\'s the pretty hate machine I\'ve been making in my off-hours, boss.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    Sorry I used company resources for it.\r\n    </p>\r\n* You respond to them.\r\n    <p>\r\n    "You fucking wish, pigs. You\'ll never take me <em>aliiiive</em>!"\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "You work with us, moron. That makes you a pig too. God, you know, I heard Logmion was dumb, but, like... this is beyond the pale."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "Snort snort, Sergeant Robertson. Watch me fuck in your yard, ruin your harvest, and tear down all your fences. I\'ll be a million little boars before you know it."\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p>\r\n    "See? Completely, utterly, DEFCON-0 bonkers. Mad as a dipshit. Forget it, just keep cutting."\r\n    </p>\r\n-\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA sound rises louder than any torch, bomb, or promise.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLike an infinity of tiny mouths, famished. A dimming of everything grows, overtaking light and form, as if metal and plastic were dry clay, crumbling under the smallest feet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeyond the opposite of light, you see the hole widen in a blinding flash, a lion\'s roar throwing fragments into your face and eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe masked and helmeted faces that peer through, soon replaced by rifles, all dimming in the sunset of things.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTheir guns are firing, but the bullets are slowing down, instant by instant, towards the asymptotic nothing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can see their eyes slide across you, the lightless slime climbing up your legs and towards your crown, the absence of it all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNothing turns itself inside out and shows its teeth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe world vanishes, and blackness rises as a stillborn twin.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCan you hear me again, Jessie?
