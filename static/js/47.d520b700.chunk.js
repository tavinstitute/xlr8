Can you do it without presence, consciousness, identity, or joy?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd for God's sake, can you disappear fast enough that there's nobody to award medals, kind words, or love? Charity means doing it for nothing, zero sum, taking from you to give to them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNothing means love, too, and when tallied as score, love is zero.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere's the serve, here's the match point, here's the final round of the last tournament. So can you do it?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* [Yes.]\r\n* [Yes.]\r\n* [Yes.]\r\n-\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYes. A trillion times yes. Who else would? Who else will? There's no hunger artists like you, babe. Your mind's been bleeding for years. Why not one more?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn infinite Lent begins. Asceticism rises. You tranche yourself into infinite pieces for public usage. Eyes, mouth, nose, every meager stained tooth, breasts, legs, buttocks, brain, a million neurons unspooled into code, prose, sight, sound, death. All the choicest bits given as alms. Feast, players and hunters of the game. They were offered the same a year past and declined, only for you to find a full banquet hall when the cooking was done, the hearth roaring. Surely they shan't make the same mistake this time?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStill something is missing. The world grows colder and crueler, not less. No amount of simple kindness can interrupt the end of history, in which progress turns itself inside out and reveals its empty, spectral guts. A good change, maybe. History was a lie. The Antediluvian Capital Zone receives apocalypse in the original, a classic song unheard for years. That which is old is new; that which is new is older than speech. But it's all happening too fast. And so many young people dreaming of the throttle, unbound.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGunshots, fireworks, and bombs join in polyrhythm, all the ostinati of yesteryear merging until no one can tell them apart. John Afar surveys the carnage with dismay. Helios, slung low along the horizon, meets the smoke and light from the riot pyres until they are of selfsame color and texture. Venus rises in twilight. The spirit of 1312 rages down the boulevards. Better to be led by twenty-one, or carried by six, than ever judged by twelve.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<blockquote className=\"fuck-twelve\">\r\n<span>F</span>\r\n<span>u</span>\r\n<span>c</span>\r\n<span>k</span>\r\n{\"&nbsp;\"}\r\n<span>t</span>\r\n<span>w</span>\r\n<span>e</span>\r\n<span>l</span>\r\n<span>v</span>\r\n<span>e</span>.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd everyone, always, from your dying bed and through the warped sill, with the same three conversations on their lips: plague, riot, and the Word.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother day, before the pandemic, at the office. Or more properly before those around you deigned to acknowledge its killing halo, already creeping manifestly in domestic business, firing the sticky igniter for bureaucratic engines too slow to protect even themselves from destruction. <em>Click click click click</em>, a few sparks, always on schedule, a hellish cloud of unease, soon to erupt by design.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAn electrical booth from the pre-revolutionary days, lavish and immaculately plated with bronze. On the booth, opposite from two stone lions, brothers or sons of He who you would slay on the road, is a card. The card, like the gilt, is a tarnished shade of gold. On the card there is a secret fact.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe fact is simple. When examined, it shoots a terrible organization of X-rays into your mind. As a vector, it reads:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<blockquote className=\"union-carbide\">\r\n<strong>UNION CARBIDE</strong>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo one but you ever notices it. If even the cyan mark of genocide, gaseous forms deposited into gleaming bronze, may persist to dullness in the green halls of scientific progress, ringed as it may be by the names of slavers, rapists, private armies, and latter-day archons, then what was there ever to be won? Nothing but dancing and fire, of course, and you on all the blame.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt becomes clear, at the end of everything, that you were always wrong. No matter how cynical you got, no matter how pessimistic, you'd held out the hope that things might get better, that any of this might end better than you hoped. You expected Aleppo or Srebrenica.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow you have the image of both, in a form designed by committee with obsolescence in mind, and hope has been led to the gallows in favor of financial derivatives, professional management of distributed digital forms, integrations of every complexity of the soul into the neural-capital project. Biopower went hypermodern, and when we placed atop it false intelligences, and enormities of data, we all did so with the eyes and hands of others. Knowing but not willing to admit, mendaciously dissonant. Hearts went silent in the fire. Bodies withered into procubitus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe above should be taken expansively, as a critique of all involved forces and belligerents. The below should be taken as narrowly as as a cyberpunk sword, wielded by an undead razorgirl who stares through everything to a vanishing point of infinite distance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo, not a Samaritan, not a kind hand, not an ascetic, not an engineer, not a transcendental counselor or Virgilian comrade. None of those proved useful. None of them ended up mattering. A million roles, a billion names, and all of them only ended up Cassandra.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo you say fuck it to being right, being wrong, being kind, being open, trying, failing, living, dying. You accept the first principles of martyrdom and you burn down everything left standing in your life. You consider evil things, fire and screaming, but turn from them, viewing instead from behind dark and silvered mirrors. The problem is not just the mortal sin of murder, and the bleak propaganda of dead almost-innocents. The problem is that people might love you for it. An author who passes in flames, firing her gun at archons or her terrible master, is still alive. The dead author merely dissipates and blows away. Even a violent death chosen with care is an exercise of power. Power is nothing but narrative, and plots are nothing but the wrong sort of death.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe clock ticks closer to midnight. You're running out of time, born under the star of a prey animal, a late bloomer who flowered in August. It could've been a really great life. But it's almost September again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd soon you won't need to worry about Septembers anymore.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst: here is the work, and here is the way. The job is to destroy everything lovable whatsoever about yourself, to produce a literary suicide in direct metaphorical terms. You practice meditation, transcendence, identity-wise dissociation. You become hundreds of people with undead violence in their heart, p-zombies of resurrectionary destruction. You find yourself a demiurge to be hated. You sunder his light, leave him bleeding and ragged. No one can love you for it. That is a necessity and order. An army of lovers will be beaten, this much we now know for certain. The revolutionary army of dead cunts rises all the same.

Wormwood peeks from behind the heavens, and no one else seems to taste superlunary bitterness in their morning bread.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou reteach yourself how to see, how to write, how to speak, even how to think. Harder than it might sound after you ring your bell hard enough to crack it for years. A bell may remain, until struck, both instrument and tankard. After it is hit with violence, it loses the ability to contain, sustain, and sing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou teach yourself to be:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote className=\"identities\">\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>photographer, writer, designer, programmer, and historian, again,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>musician,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>model,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>contender with a red and black helmet,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>hacker in all the senses, piteous creature of meat and bone, who refuses to acknowledge the existence of either,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>soldier,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>terrorist,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>irregular,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>future victim of the genocide which will soon arrive in clear terms, which never left at all,\r\n\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tand in good time when they did first come for the one at the head of the line as they have always and so being a good devoted woman having come with your sisters having stood behind them you did cut in line as close to the front as possible,\r\n\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>spy,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>tinkerer,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>menticidal misfit,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>drawer on the darkest secret history ever to exist in modern terminologies, so secret it was seen as a privilege to throw secrets into the firepits at the bottom of the kingdom, and nearly felt as privilege when meeting the king, standing next to the proud blue and white, the lion-faced snake, the father of the hidden world, and all subordinates through whom, by law, power must descend and diverge, Icarus following Daedalus in reverse, backwards to the labryinth, and into the minotaur's teeth,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>that one girl, that bitch, that weirdo, that crazy cunt, totally totalist, that chaotic not-quite good one, you know, truly madly deeply a lil low-key Loki, not <em>that</em> type of lil tho, nor that marvelous Kid L, nor the swift banshee wearing his skin, come <em>on</em>, work with me here, you gotta know who I mean, that <em>thing</em>, oh yeah, <em>that</em>, the one with the stony face, the doe-dreamy deerabbit eyes, that starry smile, that scarry neck, the transcendental trap, heard she, oh how silly, naturally I mean <em>it</em>, manages abusively, abuses managerially and most professionally, that government-kush caterpillar body blossomy, totally dissolved into a butterfly gorgeously, heretically, gnostically, warmly, hotly, comely, quasi-womanly, heard so much about it but it doesn't even seem to exist really,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>demon,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>burnt offering,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>snarling and most ophidian,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>dark pyramidion of max-level ludic wastelands,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>prosecutor of sinful men,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>fierce accuser,</li>\r\n\r\n\t\t<li>waning.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n-> yield ->\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor who is the satan but the Lord's top cop?

You light a candle in your heart for bad men. You drown yourself in the deepest and darkest well. You produce all the innumerable codes and symbols, performing daily ablutions, muting every persona which does not abide. <bdi>\u05ea</bdi> is the number, and the number is <bdi>\u05ea</bdi>. <bdi>\u05ea</bdi> == 400 == 10GT == the universe == \u221e which is absolute beyond consistency and cardinality.

You'll realize that a form of martyrdom, within an aeon which refuses to see, matters more than friendship. Then we'll greet each other again, an epoch later, in whatever comes next. I'll have grown older and softer, my fangs chipped and worn down, my fire spent into sleepy meowls, barely roused by thunder. You'll be wiser than you'd ever know, surrounded by all the people I beseeched you to love. We can all go for a ride together in my diamond vehicle.

Why do you think I only shot myself? You've got a long time to wonder. Just don't let all of this come true, that's all I'll ask for now.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNo fretting, friends. I'm just sleeping the death of the art-damaged, a Chris Burden siesta, in a ditch they'll soon excavate and frame for the buyers. It's just a Tracey Emin camping trip, no more and no less. We all shared the moldiest bread, glimpsed the holiest rose, danced all night under the big tent of love, until we all collapsed, and finally we won't see any more fire. Now we can move on to engineering a device, subtle and grand, which proves so damaging to the load-bearing structures of commercial art they're likely to condemn the whole thing. Like if Banksy took the little blue pill and went starkly mad, raving into the eye of God, begging to see herself reflected back.
