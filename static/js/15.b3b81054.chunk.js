Two months ago the government fell. They got their asses beat, one missile at a time. The lightning smell of burned electricals and nanothermites. Screams passing across the city like sound waves through water. I get migraines every day. At this point they hardly seem plural, so much as one headache which has not yet ended and may never come to pass. The checks have finally stopped coming. Not like they'd be worth much. I eat instant noodles and trade things I no longer need for more. I can't taste much and when I can it doesn't taste good.","\n","^</p>","\n","^<p>","\n","^When I sleep, I fight monsters. They win. When I am awake, my cerebellum is barely containing a nuclear blast. Sometimes it feels like an indestructible plasteel ring inside my skull, expanding. Like a fire set inside every pore on my face. Like acid poured on my teeth. Like electricity behind my eyes. Aurae fill the walls and sky. Every irritation and every inconvenience is a knife dug into my skull, a tattoo scarified into my forehead. I weep and beat myself and I curl into the tightest ball I can. The pain always has more endurance than I do. It is always just a bit stronger than I can make myself.","\n","^</p>","\n","^<p>","\n",'^I have the sense that people know exactly what they do, that this pain is not random but deliberately inflicted on me by my "loved ones" and others unknown.

If my parents won't come back, and Paul is going to disappear too, then fuck it. No one has even told me what happened other than that he's on some sort of top-secret mission for the colonial government. Fuck them all. An entirely solitary day, which can be drawn up and designed and engineered, is preferable to any risk of destabilization. There is no room for backsliding. I spend my time online, researching cures, spitting venom at morons, explaining truth to people too young or too stupid to have come across it.","\n","^</p>","\n","^<p>","\n",'^Still it all increases. Not a day goes by below 3 on the pain scale. All the simple facts of the world feel like sandpaper on the inside of my brain. The high wail of the shower every time I turn it to hot, a sourceless banshee shriek from somewhere deep inside the domestic tubing. Harmony in triple with the tinnitus of migraine and the tinnitus of drugs, a punishingly angelic chorus. As if to say, "see, I told you so," when five minutes later it turns icy, and I am left reminding myself that pain, cold, terror, and embodiment are all, to some grand extent, decisions. What can it matter? All the towels are dirty, molded, stained, buried in piles of garbage, clothing, or that which is both. Even if the shower stays warm, even if I stay up till 0400 when no one on the block is washing clothes or dishes and the pressure\'s good, I still ended up standing or curled up in the cold, waiting to dry in the bootstrapped winter heating. If the mid-state and the end-state are a choice between pain and dissociation, then what does it matter how it begins? Why even bother to turn it to hot? Why even bother to shower? Why eat, why sleep, why wake, why dream? The fundamental question of existence recurs and resounds. How to solve it? A terrible question demands a precise answer. Should it be a large-bore, high-velocity bullet, to leave everything painful, rageful, awful that once lived in my head on the floor, my brain finally, blissfully empty? Should it be a canteen of avgas, poured over my head like a dark baptism, erupting into holy flame? If everything that rises must eventually converge, then perhaps in burning I can become purified, and all the pieces that might still be redeemed will coalesce, newly peaceful, in the upper atmosphere.',"\n","^</p>","\n","^</blockquote>","\n","ev","void","/ev","->->",{"#f":1}],chapter_00_extremely_online_22nd_birthday:["^<blockquote>","\n","^<h3>","\n","^22","\n","^</h3>","\n","^<p>","\n","^A palindrome age, mirror of childhood and portal to adulthood.

Two months ago the government fell. They got their asses beat, one missile at a time. The lightning smell of burned electricals and nanothermites. Screams passing across the city like sound waves through water. I get migraines every day. At this point they hardly seem plural, so much as one headache which has not yet ended and may never come to pass. The checks have finally stopped coming. Not like they'd be worth much. I eat instant noodles and trade things I no longer need for more. I can't taste much and when I can it doesn't taste good.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I sleep, I fight monsters. They win. When I am awake, my cerebellum is barely containing a nuclear blast. Sometimes it feels like an indestructible plasteel ring inside my skull, expanding. Like a fire set inside every pore on my face. Like acid poured on my teeth. Like electricity behind my eyes. Aurae fill the walls and sky. Every irritation and every inconvenience is a knife dug into my skull, a tattoo scarified into my forehead. I weep and beat myself and I curl into the tightest ball I can. The pain always has more endurance than I do. It is always just a bit stronger than I can make myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have the sense that people know exactly what they do, that this pain is not random but deliberately inflicted on me by my \"loved ones\" and others unknown. Here is the inductive logic regarding the people who have said they \"love\" me:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>They \"want to help.\"</li>\r\n    <li>They haven't helped.</li>\r\n    <li>They know disobeying my wishes causes me excruciating pain.</li>\r\n    <li>They know that being in excruciating pain causes me to consider killing myself.</li>\r\n    <li>They disobey my wishes anyway.</li>\r\n    <li>Ergo, they want me to be in pain.</li>\r\n    <li>Thus they want me to commit suicide.</li>\r\n    <li>\u220e</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo even after the bombs walk over to the other corner of the Capital and out into the northern suburbs, I'm staying inside, because I am the only person I can trust. If my parents won't come back, and Paul is going to disappear too, then fuck it. No one has even told me what happened other than that he's on some sort of top-secret mission for the colonial government. Fuck them all. An entirely solitary day, which can be drawn up and designed and engineered, is preferable to any risk of destabilization. There is no room for backsliding. I spend my time online, researching cures, spitting venom at morons, explaining truth to people too young or too stupid to have come across it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStill it all increases. Not a day goes by below 3 on the pain scale. All the simple facts of the world feel like sandpaper on the inside of my brain. The high wail of the shower every time I turn it to hot, a sourceless banshee shriek from somewhere deep inside the domestic tubing. Harmony in triple with the tinnitus of migraine and the tinnitus of drugs, a punishingly angelic chorus. As if to say, \"see, I told you so,\" when five minutes later it turns icy, and I am left reminding myself that pain, cold, terror, and embodiment are all, to some grand extent, decisions. What can it matter? All the towels are dirty, molded, stained, buried in piles of garbage, clothing, or that which is both. Even if the shower stays warm, even if I stay up till 0400 when no one on the block is washing clothes or dishes and the pressure's good, I still ended up standing or curled up in the cold, waiting to dry in the bootstrapped winter heating. If the mid-state and the end-state are a choice between pain and dissociation, then what does it matter how it begins? Why even bother to turn it to hot? Why even bother to shower? Why eat, why sleep, why wake, why dream? The fundamental question of existence recurs and resounds. How to solve it? A terrible question demands a precise answer. Should it be a large-bore, high-velocity bullet, to leave everything painful, rageful, awful that once lived in my head on the floor, my brain finally, blissfully empty? Should it be a canteen of avgas, poured over my head like a dark baptism, erupting into holy flame? If everything that rises must eventually converge, then perhaps in burning I can become purified, and all the pieces that might still be redeemed will coalesce, newly peaceful, in the upper atmosphere.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_00_extremely_online_22nd_birthday ===\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3>\r\n22\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA palindrome age, mirror of childhood and portal to adulthood. It is today, like a present from the universe, that I found the possibility of a third way. The promise of a cure, without the endless treadmill of identical doctors with identical advice and even more useless drugs. One visit. One session. One hundred credits. One more miracle promised from the Antediluvian Restoration. It'll almost certainly be a scam, run by insane people, or both, but it's all good for a laugh at worst. And there'll be other pain patients there, which means addict networking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe name of the way is this: the TAV Institute. It's nearly impossible to determine what precisely TAV is, but their site covers what I assume are the major foci. There is the medical branch \u2014 where this here fenthead's going, to see if magic is real, and comes with scrips for something fun \u2014 and then also the research branch, somewhere between spoon-bending and hypertech R&D. And at every level it seems to be anchored by its leader, a woman referred to only as \"Mother,\" about whom little seems to be known, and about whom enormous amounts are thought and said. Simple queries surface TAV articles and satellite sites but mostly a panoply of breathless commentary. Perhaps a veteran, perhaps a terrorist, perhaps some sort of rogue government experiment, an experimental wolf who left to form her own pack of strays. By reputation, alternately brilliant, cunning, mad, violent, ascetic, loving, dangerous, revelatory, perfect, Venus, the highest adversary in the sky, in a coat skinned from lions and dyed the color of mustard gas.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat's mostly it, I guess. Just another year in the life of a wastoid. Maybe next year I'll be stoned off my ass on yoga and sunlight, right? If anything ever made me kick fent, I guess it'd be approximately that dumb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHank.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n->->\r\n\r\n\r\n=== chapter_00_extremely_online_fuck_around ===\r\n<p>\r\nThere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow it's charged to full, and ready to be fucked with.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTime to fuck about, to, fro, etc. And with the newest overseas OS, and such high resolution.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEven a great camera, and it all integrates perfectly into modern optics.
